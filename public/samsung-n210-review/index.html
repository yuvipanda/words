<p>I bought a brand new Samsung N210 Netbook about two weeks back &#8211; and have been using it almost non-stop since. I&#8217;ve been taking it to college every day, using it at every oportunity I get &#8211; on the college bus, on MTC buses, on the train, while waiting for the train, hell even <em>during</em> a rather very boring class!</p>

<h3 id="the-great">The Great</h3>

<ul>
<li>The Screen! The <strong>matte</strong> screen is totally awesome. Viewable under all conditions &#8211; full on sunlight during a train commute or at a weird angle snuggled under the desk during class. It is sharp, and IMO has enough resolution (1024&#215;600). The bezel is small and not very distracting.</li>
<li>The Keyboard. 94% of a full size keyboard, I&#8217;m told. It is extremely comfortable, and I don&#8217;t miss too many keys. I do find the right shift absolutely useless though. The chicklet keys look great too</li>
<li>The Looks. One guy asked me if I was carrying a white MacBook.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="the-good">The Good</h3>

<ul>
<li>The Touchpad. It is large and the mouse buttons are not bad. I don&#8217;t know if it supports two button finger scroll on Linux &#8211; but it does work on Windows. My hands do accidentally touch it often while typing, moving my cursor unexpectedly &#8211; but I have been able to stop that by using my right thumb for space instead of my left.</li>
<li>The Battery. I seem to get around 8 hours of usage under varying circumstances and conditions &#8211; while nothing to laugh at, I was expecting more. Might be because I haven&#8217;t been able to figure out a way to turn off the wifi chip from Linux.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="the-bad">The Bad</h3>

<ul>
<li>The Heat. The fan isn&#8217;t very noisy, but the heat buildup is appreciable. I can&#8217;t really work with it directly on my lap.</li>
<li>The inbuilt webcam. 0.3 Megapixels. Bleh!</li>
<li>WiFi. Drops <em>very</em> often, and not very sensitive. Ubuntu Autodetected it though.</li>
<li>The SD Card Slot. It has a cover that comes right off, and I guarentee I&#8217;ll lose it in a while.</li>
<li>Many of the Function Key functions aren&#8217;t supported on Linux. Was able to make the Brightness keys work after a hack though.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="the-awful">The Awful</h3>

<ul>
<li>The ugly black sticker ad for <em>&#8220;Phoenix Hyperspace&trade; Instant-on&#8221;</em>. Ewww! Atleast there is only one big sticker spoiling this white beauty</li>
</ul>

<p>Was it worth the 20k bucks I paid for it? I&#8217;m typing out this blog post while waiting at my Doctor&#8217;s, so I&#8217;d say it <em>is</em> well worth the 20k bucks paid :)</p>
