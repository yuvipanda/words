<p><em>[Note: I&#8217;ve a rather large backlog of blog posts to do, will push them out as soon as I can]</em></p>

<p>Saturday (22 Jan 2011) was spent at <a href="http://www.geekweekend.in/index.html">Geekweekend</a>, organized at <a href="http://www.thoughtworks.com/other-offices">Thougtworks Chennai</a>. The event had awesomeness written all over it, even before it started &#8211; how can <em>any</em> event where you register through a (rather limited, but still) command line interface on a website be not good? :D</p>

<p>I was late as usual (damn living so far away from everywhere) &#8211; and found my way walking through the underbelly of the Kathipara junction thanks to <a href="http://maps.google.co.in">Google Maps&#8217; Walking Directions</a> :P</p>

<h2 id="clojure">Clojure</h2>

<p>Missed the first session. Turned up for the clojure session &#8211; it was good. I&#8217;ve been meaning to learn one of the OMGPARANTHESES langueages, and from the tooling/library support &#8211; clojure seems to be the way to go. Spent time during the talk setting up my machine to do clojure dev (took forever to setup &#8211; it is a netbook, afterall). Wanted to build something small before the end of the event (like a URL Shortener!) but too late for that.</p>

<p>I do plan on writing something with clojure in the short term though. Looking for ideas.</p>

<h2 id="lunch">Lunch</h2>

<p>Lunch. Met the usual group of geeks around. Fun, as usual :D Lunch was excellent. Me and <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/sup3rkiddo">Superkiddo</a> continued the tradition of stealing sweets from <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/justjkk">Kishore</a>&#8216;s plate :D</p>

<h2 id="monads">Monads</h2>

<p>Then came the session on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monad_(functional_programming)">Monads</a>. I still don&#8217;t understand them. But that&#8217;s okay &#8211; the discussion was rather intellectually stimulating. It also reminded me that my mathematical/theoretical-cs foundation is incredibly weak (by geek standards) and needs updating/pushing up. Should start on <a href="http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/">SICP</a> (<em>again</em>).</p>

<h2 id="purely-functional-languages-on-the-fringe">Purely Functional Languages on the fringe</h2>

<p>The discussions were the most fun, productive part of the day, IMO. Most people who weren&#8217;t fully interested had already left &#8211; so the self-selected crowd was rather intense. Nobody there was actually using any purely functional language in production &#8211; which was expected. My opinion is that <em>purely</em> functional languages will always be on the fringe &#8211; as they should be. But features from them will trickle in slowly into mainstream, <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/avg.html">blub</a> programming languages (even PHP <a href="http://php.net/manual/en/functions.anonymous.php">has lambdas</a> now!). Learning to think in a functional way will expand your mind, and make you a better programmer &#8211; even if you&#8217;re not programming in a purely functional language.</p>

<h2 id="my-irrational-hate-for-java">My Irrational Hate for Java</h2>

<p>I&#8217;m not sure from where &#8212; perhaps the fucked up Java GUI apps, or my early stage semicolon/case-sensitivity hate (hey, I was 14, what do you expect!) or the fact that Java the language is way too verbose &#8212; I&#8217;ve had an irrational <strong>hate</strong> of all things Java/JVM. But that&#8217;s just that &#8211; irrational. So I&#8217;m taking a concerted effort to learn myself some JVM &#8211; hence clojure. I still don&#8217;t like Java the language (C# FTW!) &#8211; but the tools and libraries around JVM seem to be pretty good. Let&#8217;s see how this experiment at de-biasing turns out!</p>

<h2 id="functional-programming-users-group">Functional Programming Users group</h2>

<p>The idea of a Functional Language Users group was floated around. Waiting for it to turn up!</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: <a href="http://fpug-c.posterous.com/#!/">Here you go</a>. Join up and keep posting. I&#8217;m not sure how the idea of posterous groups will work out though.</p>

<h2 id="thoughtworks-8216-crowd-8217">Thoughtworks &#8216;crowd&#8217;</h2>

<p>I&#8217;ve generally found that events organized at Thoughworks/by Thoughtworkers have higher average audience quality than most other events. Thanks for putting together events guys :)</p>
