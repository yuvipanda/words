      <description>&lt;p&gt;I went to the protests at SFO last weekend. It was the first real set of protests I&amp;rsquo;ve been to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was there for about 10h on day 1, and came home exhausted. I went back on Day 2, and this time stayed for much shorter period of time (~4h?) before heading back home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I woke up that saturday feeling very depressed, angry, and helpless. By sunday night, I was only depressed and angry - but not helpless. The number and variety of people at the protests was very heartwarming, and made me feel distinctly not alone. Before going I was not sure what going to a protest accomplishes. I still do not know - but I know it gave me hope. Maybe that is good enough?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everyone who was at the protest even if it does not directly affect you yet - thank you!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I promise I&amp;rsquo;ll continue doing all I can, even and especially when it is about things that do not affect me yet. I hope you do too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First they came for the Muslims and we said &amp;ldquo;not this time, motherfucker.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;- from a sign at the protest&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <title>making twitter useful again</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve unfollowed everyone I follow on Twitter, and am slowly starting back up from scratch. I&amp;rsquo;m only going to follow people who are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Underrepresented people in Tech (as broadly construed)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Journalists&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that&amp;rsquo;s it. I&amp;rsquo;ll follow back friends I&amp;rsquo;m not otherwise in contact with as well, but might take a while.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve had this for a few days and am already enjoying using it far more than I did before. A lot of the people I&amp;rsquo;m following now I did not know before, and the vibe is totally different. I&amp;rsquo;m able to understand and appreciate things I was not able to before. I know this is a bubble, but it is certainly a different bubble than the one I was in before. Bubbles also intersect - I&amp;rsquo;ve interactions with other types of people elsewhere, just not on Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I unfollowed you, don&amp;rsquo;t take it personally! DM me for a phone number you can use for Signal / WhatsApp / Telegram - that&amp;rsquo;s how 90% of my social activities seem to happen these days anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;h/t to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.gaijin.com/&#34;&gt;Jorm&lt;/a&gt; for the idea of targetted following!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update&lt;/strong&gt;: I&amp;rsquo;ve also setup &lt;a href=&#34;https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/leechblock/&#34;&gt;LeechBlock&lt;/a&gt; to only allow me 5mins of Twitter every 2h, and I don&amp;rsquo;t have the twitter app on my phone. I wish there was a leechblock type thing for my Phone tho.&lt;/p&gt;
