      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve unfollowed everyone I follow on Twitter, and am slowly starting back up from scratch. I&amp;rsquo;m only going to follow people who are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Minorities in Tech&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Journalists&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that&amp;rsquo;s it. I&amp;rsquo;ll follow back friends I&amp;rsquo;m not otherwise in contact with as well, but might take a while.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve had this for a few days and am already enjoying using it far more than I did before. A lot of the people I&amp;rsquo;m following now I did not know before, and the vibe is totally different. I&amp;rsquo;m able to understand and appreciate things I was not able to before. I know this is a bubble, but it is certainly a different bubble than the one I was in before. Bubbles also intersect - I&amp;rsquo;ve interactions with other types of people elsewhere, just not on Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I unfollowed you, don&amp;rsquo;t take it personally! DM me for a phone number you can use for Signal / WhatsApp / Telegram - that&amp;rsquo;s how 90% of my social activities seem to happen these days anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;h/t to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.gaijin.com/&#34;&gt;Jorm&lt;/a&gt; for the idea of targetted following!&lt;/p&gt;
