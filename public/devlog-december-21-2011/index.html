<li>livetrains work. Trying to move (minimal) build system to waf. Somewhat complicated, not as fluid as I&#8217;d like. Go to rake. Feel weird about starting from scratch, come back to waf. Not get anything done Another rake diversion. Final Makefile editing desperation. I give up &#8211; I need to spend atleast a day to get back on proper build tools. That day is not today.

<ol>
<li>Added feature to change font size to wikipedia app. That took almost a couple of days and ended up being less than 20 lines of code. First was trying to enable pinch and zoom, but only for an iframe &#8211; proved impossible. And then a long time of headwalling about how I&#8217;m not able to manipulate the DOM inside the iframe (despite code in other places being able to do it just fine (no crossdomain issues here)), I had given up and moved elsewhere. Finally brion suggested I try inserting a <link> into <head>, which actually did work. So much for the browser being sane</li>
<li>&#8216;Refined&#8217; the search behavior of the wikipedia app a bit more. Also got bit by a difference between zepto (that we use) and jQuery (whose docs I have to read, since zepto by itself seems to have no docs). Had to read through the code to fix it, and managed to.</li>
<li>Closed a *lot* of bugs. BOY THAT FEELS GREAT!</li>
