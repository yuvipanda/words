			      <p>Should I tell her?</p>

<p>I shouldn&#8217;t.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t even know her. She&#8217;s new in class. So am I. We&#8217;re all new in this class. We are first years, at the first day of college.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t even know her name! And she obviously doesn&#8217;t know my name. We are, for all intents and purposes, complete strangers in the same class.</p>

<p>What if she takes it seriously? I&#8217;ll probably be branded the classholic flirt of the class, and never be taken seriously ever again. I&#8217;ll be banned, and I can&#8217;t even use a sock puppet!</p>

<p>But, she doesn&#8217;t look like the type who take it seriously. Now, <em>that</em> girl over there? The type to take things seriously. I&#8217;d probably get a sternly worded letter from her dad if I so much looked at her. And a few broken bones if I tried talking. Meh.</p>

<p>But her. She doesn&#8217;t look anything like that at all. I could see her laughing with her nascent <em>friends</em>. Over some piece of silly joke probably. Or maybe a comment about some guy. Who knows! Just one of the things girls normally just laugh about and then say &#8216;what? nothing&#8217; when you ask them about it later. There&#8217;s probably a term for that. &#8216;Sweet nothings?&#8217; I don&#8217;t know. Ask a girl.</p>

<p>Maybe I should just go and tell her. It&#8217;s no big deal. It&#8217;s not like nobody ever does stuff like this. Yeah, it&#8217;ll be the first time for me, but heck! Everyone has a first time! I&#8217;ll probably get used to it.</p>

<p>Okay, I&#8217;ll just walk up to her, say &#8220;Hi&#8221;, and then say it. No big deal. If it works, it works. If it doesn&#8217;t, it doesn&#8217;t. Big deal!</p>

<p>I walked up to the gang of giggles. &#8220;Hey!&#8221;. I got an enthusiastic, sweet sounding &#8220;Hey!&#8221; back.</p>

<p>Wow, awesome voice! Now, not to lose composure. Just say it already goddarn it!</p>

<p>&#8220;Pretty dress you&#8217;ve got!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Awww cute! Thank you!&#8221;</p>

<p>Wow, that &#8216;omg squeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee&#8217; voice again. Seriously? It&#8217;s almost like speaking to a grown up kid! But I&#8217;ve got to say it!</p>

<p>&#8220;Just the dress&#8221;</p>

<p>(<em>And thus began the most vile, spineless, soulless part of his life. And NO, you do not want to know how it ended</em>)</p>

<p>(<em>All parts of this story are complete, utter, crappy attempts at fiction, ofcoruse!</em>)</p>
