<p>Women roaming around drunk in clubs
What the fuck is happening in Tamil Nadu
I salute you all
All your honor is flying away</p>

<p>Women roaming around drunk in clubs
What the fuck is happening in Tamil Nadu
I salute you all
All your honor is flying away</p>

<p>Hi girls, first you say &lsquo;how are you?&rsquo;
After knowing me for 10 months you say
&lsquo;Who are you?&rsquo;
Just three words &lsquo;I love you&rsquo;
Don&rsquo;t you even know the meaning of that?</p>

<p>Hey Sheena, Leena, Meena, Veena,
Don&rsquo;t show off as knowing only little bits
of tamil with a foreign accent,
If you leave Tamil Nadu and go out,
does not mean you have to forget your mother tongue Tamil</p>

<p>Rohini, Yohini, Yamini, Kamini,
Think they are hot but are actually funny,
Don&rsquo;t blame men pointlessly,
(He is looking at me only!) Why do you do this?</p>

<p>Women roaming around drunk in clubs
What the fuck is happening in Tamil Nadu
I salute you all
All your honor is flying away</p>

<p>Women roaming around drunk in clubs
What the fuck is happening in Tamil Nadu
I salute you all
All your honor is flying away</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not blaming all women,
The deity who gave birth to me is also a woman.
All the guys come to my side,
or these girls will spoil you as well</p>

<p>Of 100, 50 are like these,
Roaming around clubs drinking and smoking,
From the time when women cooked nice food,
OH MY GOD NOW THEY ARE SMOOKING GANJA WHAT A SHAME</p>

<p>Women roaming around drunk in clubs
What the fuck is happening in Tamil Nadu
I salute you all
All your honor is flying away</p>

<p>Women roaming around drunk in clubs
What the fuck is happening in Tamil Nadu
I salute you all
All your honor is flying away</p>

<p>Pretty woman, with pretty eyes
BUT SHE HAS ONE BOTTLE OF RUM!</p>

<p>Pretty woman, with pretty eyes,
BUT WITH RUM SHE HAS HALF A PACK OF CIGARETTES</p>

<p>Pretty fairy, I don&rsquo;t need you,
You are dancing heavily drunk.</p>

<p>Gone are the times when women wore jewellery,
Now they keep smoking everywhere.
Instead of wearing sarees,
THEY ARE WEARING HANDKERCHEIFS!</p>

<p>Women roaming around drunk in clubs
What the fuck is happening in Tamil Nadu
I salute you all
All your honor is flying away</p>

<p>Women roaming around drunk in clubs
What the fuck is happening in Tamil Nadu
I salute you all
All your honor is flying away</p>

<p>Gone are the times when women wore jewellery,
Now they keep smoking everywhere.
Instead of wearing sarees,
THEY ARE WEARING HANDKERCHEIFS!
THEY ARE WEARING HANDKERCHEIFS!
(Shows handkerchief for emphasis)</pre></p>

<p>As far as I know, this is not satire.</p>
