      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m writing up monthly &amp;lsquo;work plans&amp;rsquo; to plan what work I&amp;rsquo;m trying to do every month, and do a retrospective after to see how much I got done. I work across a variety of open source projects with ambiguous responsibilities, so work planning isn&amp;rsquo;t very set. This has proven to be somewhat quite stressful for everyone involved. Let&amp;rsquo;s see if this helps!
JupyterCon JupyterCon is in NYC towards the end of August, and it is going to set the pace for a bunch of stuff.</description>

      <title>Conda Constructor Thoughts</title>

      <description>Inspired by conversations with Nick Bollweg and Matt Rocklin, I experimented with using conda constructor as the installer for The Littlest JupyterHub. Theoretically, it fit the bill perfectly - I wanted a way to ship arbitrary packages in multiple languages (python &amp;amp; node) in an easy to install self-contained way, didn&amp;rsquo;t want to make debian packages &amp;amp; wanted to use a tool that people in the Jupyter ecosystem were familiar with.</description>

      <description>This idea comes from brainstorming along with Lindsey Heagy, Carol Willing, Tim Head &amp;amp; Nick Bollweg at the Jupyter Team Meeting 2018. Most of the good ideas are theirs! The name is inspired by one of favorite TV series of one of my favorite people.
I really love the idea of JupyterHub distributions - opinionated combination of components that target a specific use case. The Zero to JupyterHub distribution is awesome &amp;amp; works for most people.</description>

      <description>Recently I had to write some code that had to call the kubernetes API directly, without any language wrappers. While there is pretty good reference docs, I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to go and construct all the JSON manually in my programming language.
I discovered that kubectl&amp;rsquo;s -v parameter is very useful for this! With this, I can do the following:
 Perform the actions I need to perform with just kubectl commands Pass -v=8 to kubectl when doing this, and this will print all the HTTP traffic (requests and responses!</description>

      <description>I haven&amp;rsquo;t done a &amp;lsquo;year in retrospective&amp;rsquo; publicly for a long time, but after reading Alice Goldfuss&amp;rsquo; 2017 year in review decided to do one for me too!
This is a very filtered view - there are lots of important people &amp;amp; events in 2017 that are not contained here, and that is ok.

      <title>Why repo2docker? Why not s2i?</title>
      <link>http://words.yuvi.in/post/why-not-s2i/</link>

      <guid>http://words.yuvi.in/post/why-not-s2i/</guid>
      <description>The wonderful Graham Dumpleton asked on twitter why we built an entirely new tool (repo2docker) instead of using OpenShift&amp;rsquo;s cool source2image tool.
This is a very good question, and not a decision we made lightly. This post lays out some history, and explains the reasons we decided to stop using s2i. s2i is still a great tool for most production use cases, and you should use it if you&amp;rsquo;re building anything like a PaaS!</description>

      <description>I was at maintainerati today, which was super fun &amp;amp; quite intense! I highly appreciate GitHub &amp;amp; the individuals involved in making it happen!
Here&amp;rsquo;s my key takeaways from this (and several other conversations over the last few weeks leading up to this):
 I am now a maintainer, which is quite a different thing from a core contributor or just a contributor. The power dynamics are very different, and so are the responsibilities.</description>

I&amp;rsquo;ve picked up ideas on scaling systems through the years, but never actually sat down to actually study them semi-formally. This seems like a great start to it!
It&amp;rsquo;s a pretty big book, and it&amp;rsquo;s gonna take me a while to go through it :) Will update these notes as I go! Trying to do a chapter a week!</description>

      <description>Following a trail from a wonderful Julia Evans post led me to Allen Downey&amp;rsquo;s nice textbook manifesto. Also led me to the nice Think OS book, which seems like a super nice introduction to Operating System principles.
It is short enough (~100 pages) that I wanted to read through it. I&amp;rsquo;ve spent a good chunk of time absorbing how Operating Systems work by dint of diving into things and working through them, but it would be nice to get a refresher on the basics.</description>

      <description>I am trying to understand SELinux and AppArmor, and collecting resources here as I learn. k
SELinux for mere mortals (2014)  This was the first video I watched, and it helped me understanding what SELinux does at a fundamental basic level. It&amp;rsquo;s probably useless in a container-filled world (where I doubt Fedora shipes pre-configured SELinux rules for my containers), but it helped me think I understood types / labels, so that seems like a positive step?</description>

There&amp;rsquo;s an analogous running list of things I want to learn. Things move between them :) I also have higher standards of documentation (other people should be able to use it) before marking these as complete.
 kubernetes-login A helper to openssh that allows users to log in to a configurable user pod running on a kubernetes cluster. Should ideally support scp / sftp too.</description>

      <description>I was in a conversation about the Python GIL with friends a few days ago, and realized that my understanding of the specifics of the GIL problem were super hand-wavy &amp;amp; unstructured. So I spent some time collecting resources to learn more, and now have a better understanding!
Python&amp;rsquo;s Infamous GIL (Larry Hastings) This was a great introduction to the history of the GIL, why it was necessary &amp;amp; reasons why getting rid of it is complicated.</description>

      <guid>http://words.yuvi.in/post/systemd-simple-containment/</guid>
      <description>I earlier had a vaguely working setup for making sure browsers, shells and other applications don&amp;rsquo;t eat all RAM / CPU on my machine with systemd + sudo + shell scripts.
It was a hacky solution, and also had complications when used to launch shells. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t passing in all the environment varialbes it should, causing interesting-to-debug issues. sudo rules were complex, and hard to do securely.
I had also been looking for an excuse to learn more Golang, so I ended up writing systemd-simple-containment or ssc.</description>

      <description>Update: There&amp;rsquo;s a follow-up post with a simpler solution now.
Ever since I read Jessie Frazelle&amp;rsquo;s amazing setup (1, 2, 3) for running GUI applications in docker containers, I&amp;rsquo;ve wanted to do something similar. However, I want to install things on my computer - not in docker images. So what I wanted was just isolation (no more Chrome / Firefox freezing my laptop), not images. I&amp;rsquo;m also not as awesome (or knowledgeable!</description>

      <description>Keeping a running list of things I want to learn!
There&amp;rsquo;s also a list of things I want to build.
 How to use org mode properly? Should I use it for notes over markdown? Develop a deep understanding of how networks work. How do linux network namespaces work? How to run GUI apps with systemd?  I did learn! Both a hacky version and a much better version that also taught me some Go!</description>

      <description>I ran into this thought provoking though when randomly attempting to relax this weekend. There&amp;rsquo;s a summary at LWN if you do not want to watch the talk - but as the lwn summarizer admits, the video definitely conveys things that are hard to capture on text.
The core takeaway for me is to think about:
 what is the future of free and open-source software? The answer was: it has no future.</description>

      <description>I went to the protests at SFO last weekend. It was the first real set of protests I&amp;rsquo;ve been to. I write this to attempt to capture a sliver of what I felt that day.
I was there for about 10h on day 1, and came home exhausted. I went back on Day 2, and this time stayed for much shorter period of time (~4h?) before heading back home.
To everyone who was at the protest even if it does not directly affect you yet - thank you!</description>

 Underrepresented people in Tech (as broadly construed) Journalists  And that&amp;rsquo;s it. I&amp;rsquo;ll follow back friends I&amp;rsquo;m not otherwise in contact with as well, but might take a while.
I&amp;rsquo;ve had this for a few days and am already enjoying using it far more than I did before.</description>

 I was amazed at the amount of prior research it is citing. Why have I not been reading these for the last 10 years of my life? Apparently it is ok to report findings with a sample size of 10 people.</description>

      <description>localhost is always 127.0.0.1, right? Nope, can also be ::1 if your system only has IPV6 (apparently).
Asking a DNS server for an A record for localhost should give you back 127.0.0.1 right? Nope &amp;#8211; it varies wildly! 8.8.8.8 gives me an NXDOMAIN which means it tells you straight up THIS DOMAIN DOES NOT EXIST! Which is true, since localhost isn&amp;#8217;t a domain. But if you ask the same thing of any dnsmasq server, it&amp;#8217;ll tell you localhost is 127.</description>

Random notes.
 Kicked out NFS from the Tool Labs proxies (with 1). Yay! This hopefully explains the lockup of tools-proxy-01 yesterday night, maybe? It&amp;#8217;s been restarted since, and I hope to no longer have instances randomly locoking on me. Infrastructure standards of 2009, here we come! :D I&amp;#8217;ve also removed NFS from tools-redis, and migrated them to Jessie as well.</description>

Also saw the old devlog mailing list and feeling happy memories. Clearly need to bring something back like that, but I don&amp;#8217;t know / think mailing lists are the best medium. More thinking!
Ended up learning some Tornad and wrote nbserve to serve rendered notebooks and static files in a configurable way. I should refactor PAWS to have separate jupyterhub, proxy and nbserve pods tomorrow.</description>

      <description>Today looks like a day of finding, reporting and fixing bugs in WikiChatter. I had made a stupid mistake yesterday that meant not all of the Teahouse pages were being parsed, and I immediately started running into bugs. Have reported (and fixed!) two (1 and 2), and ran into another bug in mediawikiparserfromhell itself. I&amp;#8217;m sure I&amp;#8217;ll find more.  Another bug in WikiChatter! 3 Perils of digging through archives &amp;#8211; you find Wikipedians giving relationship advice.</description>

 Discovered the WikiChatter library (thanks to @halfak!), and using that in my Teahouse analysis notebook. Far better than writing my own parser and fighting with that.

      <description>DevLog for Jan 5, 2015
Trying out the ByWord app, since it has MarkDown support and also publishes to WordPress. Paid Rs. 900 for it, let&amp;#8217;s hope it is useful. Hate the default font, though.
 Need to parse View definitions on labsdb public databases and verify that we aren&amp;#8217;t leaking any info (https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T85783). Was going to use the sqlparse library, but that doesn&amp;#8217;t seem very complete or useful. Will attempt to use regexes now.</description>

      <description>Nothing much going on&amp;#8230;
 Continue reading Real World Haskell. This is indeed expanding my horizons, but I haven&amp;#8217;t found any project I could use haskell in yet. Will keep looking. Helped fix a parsoid outage yesterday. No biggie. I still do not understand fully how parsoid works / how it is set up, should do. Spend most of the rest of the time in &amp;#8216;weekend mode&amp;#8217;, which includes mostly not doing things.</description>

      <description>Woohoo, 2015! :) Let&amp;#8217;s see if I can keep this going this time :)
 Have started taking weekends slightly more seriously. My brain feels less overwhelmed after that. Should take weekends even more seriously going forward. Merged labsdb-auditor rewrite patch. Code clean enough for my tastes now, although not documented enough. Lots of back and forth CR with valhallasw was really nice &amp;#8211; it&amp;#8217;s something I&amp;#8217;ve been missing for the past few months.</description>

      <description>Was a great idea! It just worked (with an OTP cable), and I can now probably find much more uses for this thing than I could before. Yay!
I wonder if I can use this to write code. However, a 7 inch tablet is very poorly suited for that task &amp;#8211; would need at least a 10&amp;#8243; one. But there aren&amp;#8217;t many of those going around these days&amp;#8230;
I&amp;#8217;ll probably use this for random browsing / commenting, and use my Mac for actual programming.</description>

      <description>That was a long break. Should get into better habits. I&amp;#8217;m sure I&amp;#8217;d miss some here. Oh well.
It was a very interesting week, culminating in some very interesting things at Trafalgar Square. I feel much better as a person and more calmer/chilled out now :) Should remember to take weekends off.
 Helped the WikiMetrics people with some puppet changes. They were requiring mysql directly instead of using the class we have in ops/puppet, which meant it put data in the /var partition instead of in /srv.</description>

Some Android app work, and lots of monitoring work
 Fixed bugs causing the Wikipedia Android Alpha from building properly. Now it builds properly whenever there is a new commit. Hooray! This was primarily caused by me forgetting to give it lots of RAM (8G VMEM) to execute the mvn build commands (https://gerrit.</description>

      <description>Missed DevLogging for a while.
Am in London now.
 Started using a spare Majestouch Ninja 2 over my regular Kinesis Advantage. This is way more portable, and my hand does not seem to be hurting while using it (so far only about 4-5 hours). If this keeps up, I should be able to move to a similar smaller keyboard over the much bulkier kinesis. There&amp;#8217;s still a little bit of discomfort, so I&amp;#8217;ll probably want a very portable and mechanical split keyboard.</description>

      <description>Let&amp;#8217;s see. I&amp;#8217;m also going to attempt to include patch links wherever possible.
 Cleaned up session handling bugs in Quarry. They were previously not closing properly, causing SQLAlchemy exceptions now and then that&amp;#8217;ll let queries die in a &amp;#8216;queued&amp;#8217; state. This should hopefully be fixed by https://gerrit.wikimedia.org/r/#/c/156909/. Made https://graphite.wmflabs.org somewhat more stable again for use by Wikimedia BetaLabs folks by just blacklisting all other projects from sending data to it (with a local whitelist hack + https://gerrit.</description>

      <description>Not very code heavy
 Couple of pull requests(#1 and #2) for the Atom Autosave plugin. One adds a preference to not autosave by when you are explicitly closing a window / pane, and the other just sets the &amp;#8216;enabled&amp;#8217; preference to default. CoffeeScript isn&amp;#8217;t too bad either! I should consider writing more plugins (I currently use Atom for CSS/JS/Puppet, should try other languages) Added CSV, TSV and JSON download options to Quarry.</description>

      <description>Wooooo!
 Moved labsbooks (described in yesterday&amp;#8217;s devlog) to use a shared readonly IPython virtualenv maintained by me. Also installed a bunch of modules people might want to use (SciPy, NumPy, Pandas, PyTables, matplotlib). Am considering just installing IPython notebook globally via puppet and using that, since that&amp;#8217;ll enable users to just use the system packages. However, the version of IPython notebook from Ubuntu is ancient, so that&amp;#8217;s probably a non-starter.</description>

      <description>Back in Glasgow! It was actually not very cold today, only cold! Progress.
Started working on my long-abandoned labsbook project, which aims to make Tool Labs a first class environment for people who want to run (and publish) iPython Notebooks while also being able to access the replica databases and the dumps. Doing this in a secure manner is kinda hard, but I think I&amp;#8217;ve a neat solution that lets everyone run a personal iPython kernel on the Grid, access it from their local machine, and also publish it to the web from a standard location.</description>

      <description>Was in Edinburgh again, missed writing it as I went along. Oh well.
 Ported the code for the Wikipedia Android app automated builds to Python, and you can see it in action at http://tools.wmflabs.org/wikipedia-android-builds/ now. It lets you download the latest build, and notes the last successful build time. Good enough :) It was originally in bash, and porting it to python allowed me to create a &amp;#8216;fake&amp;#8217; API (just JSON blobs written to known locations in the file system).</description>

      <description>In Edinburgh! I&amp;#8217;ve finally stopped spelling it as Edinborough!
 Added &amp;#8216;user group&amp;#8217; functionality to Quarry, and added a sudo user group that does what you would think it does. Will be assigned super, super sparingly. Found out that I&amp;#8217;d have to explicitly specify charset of the database when I&amp;#8217;m creating it or MySQL will default to a stupid charset. Forced all tables and columns to utf8 and that seems to have fixed a bunch of unicode issues.</description>

Fixed this in time for&amp;#8230; Helped out with a webinar from J-Mo for people to learn SQL and do research against Wikimedia stuff with Quarry! Went without a glitch mostly, so yay :) Oren asked for an API for Quarry, I&amp;#8217;ll investigate ways to get that done Found that some queries against enwiki succeed on s1.</description>

 Wrote a small blog post talking about how to package python packages as debian packages. More work on getting Graphite setup for Wikimedia Labs. Everything is up and running now (after a number of embarrassing typos).

One of the &amp;#8216;pain points&amp;#8217; with working on deploying python stuff at Wikimedia is that pip and virtualenvs are banned on production, for some (what I now understand as) good reasons (the solid Signing / Security issues with PYPI, and the slightly less solid but nonetheless valid &amp;#8216;If we use pip for python and gem for ruby and npm for node, EXPLOSION OF PACKAGE MANAGERS and makes things harder to manage&amp;#8217;).</description>

      <description>I&amp;#8217;ve started paying for IRCCloud.
It is the first &amp;#8216;service&amp;#8217; I am paying for as a subscriber, I think. I&amp;#8217;ve considered doing that for a long time, but &amp;#8216;paying for IRC&amp;#8217; just felt&amp;#8230; odd. I&amp;#8217;ve been using ZNC + LimeChat. It&amp;#8217;s decent, but sucks on Mobile. Keeping a socket open all the time on a phone just kills the battery, plus the UX on most Android clients sucks.
So after seeing Sam Smith use IRCCloud during Wikimania, I made the plunge and paid for IRCCloud.</description>

Been a whirlwind few months. I&amp;#8217;m moving to the Wikimedia Ops team soon! The Wikipedia app has been released! Lots of excitement around, should do a bigger post sometime with details. This should just follow usual devlog format of stuff for the day
 Completed deployment of changing the results backend of Quarry to SQLite. That was a fun exercise, and I should write about that separately.</description>

And then a few days later I realized that it is talking about &amp;#8216;the book&amp;#8216;. That is now doubly funny because of the Boy Scouts&amp;#8217; attitude towards gays</description>

The philosophers are incredibly funny wherever they turn up too. The Desert after you Die bit was&amp;#8230; beautiful &amp;#8211; Judgement happens, but by yourself. Fun digs at governments and organized religion throughout made it rather enjoyable :)

      <description>Pro Git is a nice book I recommend to newbies &amp;#8211; yet I hadn&amp;#8217;t fully read it once. I decided to do so, and I think it was reasonably useful. Most of the stuff in here I already knew, and the treatment of the stuff I did not (Git Internals, mostly) wasn&amp;#8217;t deep enough to be useful. Nevertheless, reinforced some useful concepts in my head and probably gave me enough strong foundations for when I decide to dive into the actual internals of git more (probably by reading the source code?</description>

      <description>I&amp;#8217;ve been reading a lot over the last few months (Discworld + Foundation gives me about 24 books in the last 3 months), and figured I&amp;#8217;d extend that for the next year with a little more underlying planning. So along with Bala, Arun &amp;amp; Surya, I&amp;#8217;ll try to read a hundred books this year, and also do a blog post each about them.
Hogfather is the 21st book in the Discworld series I&amp;#8217;ve read.</description>

      <description>&amp;#8220;Write once, attempt to debug everywhere&amp;#8221; is probably way more accurate than &amp;#8220;Write once, run anywhere&amp;#8221; &amp;#8211; at least for GUI apps. There&amp;#8217;s something rather special about ideas that are theoretically amazingly wonderful yet end up being a major pain in the butt when you try to put them in practice, isn&amp;#8217;t it?
The older Wikipedia App happened to be in PhoneGap, and I consider it one of my biggest blunders to not have torn it down on day 0 and rewritten it in something saner.</description>

      <description>I&amp;#8217;ve given up on trying to make DevLogs really comprehensive and complete, and just try to make them &amp;#8211; even if they are incomplete. Perhaps this will help me actually write more devlogs, and thus make it more comprehensive&amp;#8230;
I started on the Functional Programming in Scala course today. I wanted to do it the last time, but did not find the time. This time will be different &amp;#8211; I&amp;#8217;m in a different spot mentally, and a big drain on my emotional / time resources (&amp;#8220;college&amp;#8221;) is no longer a factor.</description>

      <description>[Warning: Childish rant ahead]
My natural sleep cycle seems to be one that tends towards the darker times &amp;#8211; sleeping before 3AM feels like an abomination, before midnight unheard of. My best work seems to be done between 2AM and 5AM. My current &amp;lsquo;sleep cycle&amp;rsquo; has me sleeping at about 8AM, and waking up at about 5PM. Plenty of sleep for the day, eh?
It is probably not healthy. I don&amp;rsquo;t look, or feel healthy.</description>

I also helped merge some of MarkTraceur&amp;rsquo;s JS cleanup patches to UploadWizard. And Brion&amp;rsquo;s big detail view patch for Android Commons app. Also another cleanup/api feature patch to UploadWizard.</description>

      <description>I don&amp;rsquo;t understand how ad-blocking is even legal. It&amp;rsquo;s like stealing &amp;#8211; stealing content for free, IMHO there&amp;rsquo;s no difference between stealing MP3s and news or any other content. There&amp;rsquo;s some kind of user agreement between websites and its users &amp;#8211; &amp;ldquo;you can use our site for free, but you have to watch the ads&amp;rdquo;. Adblock violates this agreement. The people responsible for this should be in prison, they&amp;rsquo;re thieves.</description>

WLM Android App Spent some time reviving the WLM Android App. Wasn&amp;rsquo;t too hard, and am surprised at how well it still runs :) Some work still needed to update the templates and other metadata to refer to WLM2013 rather than WLM2012 &amp;#8211; but that should not be too hard. The fact that it is an issue at all is simply because I ripped out all the Campaign related APIs a few weeks ago with my UploadCampaign rewrite.</description>

      <description>Python&amp;rsquo;s PEP8 has just been changed to no longer recommend sticking to 79 columns! The new text says:
Aim to limit all lines to a maximum of 79 characters, but up to 99 characters is acceptable when it improves readability.  It would be nice to not have any such set limits at all, and just depend on programmers not being insane, but this is still an improvement!</description>

      <description>After being frustrated at Java&amp;rsquo;s lack of a generic &amp;lsquo;callback&amp;rsquo; type, I created this interface:
 public interface ContributionUploadProgress { void onUploadStarted(Contribution contribution); boolean isJavaAPieceOfShit(); }  And randomly throw around (with onComplete implementing ContributionUploadProgress)
 assert onComplete.isJavaAPieceOfShit();  This, of course, is trivial to fix with an IDE. Should be more fun with a dynamic language :)

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m on my longest GitHub Streak this year &amp;#8211; currently 20 days (was previously 18 days). That means I&amp;rsquo;ve had at least one commit (though usually more!) each day for the last 20 days. Sounds much easier than it actually is. Wanting to keep my streak unbroken is also making me write more diverse code &amp;#8211; I think those 20 days feature code in Javascript, Python, Java, PHP and Python. It&amp;rsquo;s also distributed across a lot of projects &amp;#8211; at least 8-9 different ones on last count.</description>

I should learn J at some point, I think. My problem with trying to learn such languages is that I find it hard to find something to build that&amp;rsquo;s not a mere academic exercise, and I still do not have a solution as such. Just &amp;lsquo;try harder&amp;rsquo; doesn&amp;rsquo;t really work. Perhaps invent some sort of wonderful number crunching idea and then implement it?</description>

      <description>When running Redis in a shared cluster/hosting environment (such as Wikimedia Tool Labs, on which I&amp;rsquo;ve been having fun doing a lot of work on), you would want to try to provide at least some guarantee of isolation for your keys from everyone else&amp;rsquo;s keys. Since Redis doesn&amp;rsquo;t do ACLs, this is problematic.
This can be solved in a couple of ways
Run a Redis instance for each user This is simple enough to do &amp;#8211; each user runs their own Redis instance, and has full access to it.</description>

I had a nice Vim plugin that posted to wordpress for a while, but that seems to have stopped working. The WordPress interface itself is mostly fine, but still a fair bit &amp;#8216;meh&amp;#8217;.
Platen is a markdown based editor that&amp;#8217;s a Chrome Web Store app that looks cool so far.</description>

      <description>Comedy Central has been banned in India for the next ten days. Reasons?
 Whereas, the programme showed a man performing an act of stand_up comedy and mouthing vulgar words accompanied by obscene and suggestive gesture and gyration. During his performance, the man was shown uttering dialogues denigrating women, indecently and crudely referred to sex organs of men-and women and the sing-song rendition by the man sought to pornographically describe .</description>

Growing up to lose respect for people you considered heros is a horrible thing. Friends don&amp;#8217;t let friends fall prey to emotional blackmail.</description>

      <description>Screenshot of Autosuggest working in Tamil on my variant of the Android keyboard. I&amp;#8217;ve been working on this on and off for the last few months (this is also my final year project in college). I&amp;#8217;ve ported all of the jQuery.IME languages to work on the keyboard natively.
Now experimenting with Autosuggest. It only needs an appropriate dictionary now and we&amp;#8217;ll be good to go. Currently I&amp;#8217;m getting Autosuggest working only on Tamil, but the plan is to get it to work for all Indian languages.</description>

 Like if you ask three separate groups of Canadian households how much they&amp;#8217;ll pay to save two thousand, twenty thousand, or two hundred thousand birds from dying in oil ponds, the three groups will respectively state that they&amp;#8217;re willing to pay seventy-eight, eighty-eight, and eighty dollars. No difference, in other words. It&amp;#8217;s called scope insensitivity. Your brain imagines a single bird struggling in an oil pond, and that image creates some amount of emotion that determines your willingness to pay.</description>

      <description>Mediawiki has a number of humorous bug reports, though not as many as I&amp;#8217;d like. Still, they&amp;#8217;re quite funny.
I think my favorites are the request for RESOLVED MURDERED, the real reason why MediaWiki runs on MySQL, someone asking where the community consensus is to stop Volcanoes exploding, offers of shamanic help, a ground breaking report on US Government corruption, and a warning about zoning laws required for shipping Ponies,</description>

      <title>Calculating the population of India on Wikipedia</title>

      <guid>http://words.yuvi.in/calculating-population-india-wikipedia/</guid>
      <description>Exploring the English Wikipedia randomly, I encountered this template used to approximate the current live population of India. It uses the following simple formula:
 (1176242 + 42.197260273969 * days_since(2010,1,26)) * 000  It&amp;#8217;s based on population at a specific data + projected growth. The &amp;#8216;update&amp;#8217; is done by (best guess) some bot hitting action=purge every night to re-do the calculation.
And where is this used? After looking at the template&amp;#8217;s info page, the only article this seems to be used in is the India article, and that too only for population density statistics, rather than actual population statistics.</description>

Has quote about how Jesus was Indian, because among other things, because &amp;#8220;Parents had a son without having sex&amp;#8221;.
This entire BBC series (Goodness Gracious Me) is incredibly hilarious. Most of them are on Youtube. Highly recommended.

      <description>Trigger warning: Completely inappropriate background music for the subject matter being discussed
I ran into this very interesting video from Senthil&amp;#8216;s facebook feed. The part that I found most interesting was the sense of entitlement &amp;#8211; that despite not knowing anything about what they are going to be hired for (aka Programming), and admitting it to everyone, they still expect to be given jobs when they want.
While this would make sense in someplace like the military, where you go in and then train, it makes no sense for graduates of an engineering program, where they spent 4 years of their life training.</description>

Google&amp;#8217;s handling of Reader has remedied that for me, however. I was around to witness all the events that Ed Bott at ZDNet discusses, and hopefully I have learnt my lesson.</description>

      <title>Android RegEx bug: ‘null’ replacement with Matcher.replaceAll</title>

      <guid>http://words.yuvi.in/android-regex-bug-null-replacement-matcher-replaceall/</guid>
      <description>Android&amp;#8217;s Regular Expressions engine is API compatible with the generic Java implementation, but under the hood uses ICU&amp;#8217;s RegEx engine. This usually causes no problems, until it does and then you&amp;#8217;re sortof fucked, but not really.
On a recent project, a subtle bug in Android&amp;#8217;s Matcher.replaceAll behavior bit me. When replacing values of captured groups (&#39;$1&#39;&amp;lt;/code,&amp;lt;code&amp;gt;&#39;$2&#39;, etc), Android&amp;#8217;s implementation replaced a reference to an empty group with the literal string &#39;null&#39; instead of just skipping it (aka replacing with empty string &#39;&#39;), which is what most other Java implemetations do.</description>

While I&amp;#8217;ve had a vague feeling of uneasiness ever since they unveiled their now business friendly developer policies, it really hit home when my favorite Android twitter app, Falcon Pro, hit Twitter&amp;#8217;s arbitrary user token limit (and Twitter declined to care).

I built SumStorm with my own hands, bought with my own money (thanks to several amazing people on the web) when I was 16 or so. It felt amazing when I first booted it up. It felt amazing when I maxed out all its cores running distcc with my netbook.</description>

THIS IS SO COOL!
I am now editing this blog post from my new Nexus 7.

I am a few years behind the curve on this. Last year was spent slogging my ass out at a wonderful startup and travelling to a lot of places meeting and working with some wonderful people.</description>

      <description>We&amp;#8217;re the Michelangelos of the great age of machine intelligence which is yet to come. We&amp;#8217;re sketching out how it&amp;#8217;s all going to look.

 If there&amp;#8217;s a great age of machine intelligence to come, then one in a million of us may be a Michelangelo. The rest of us are house-painters, and the houses we paint are slated for demolition within our own lifetimes.</description>

No laptops allowed. No storage devices either. Cameras are okay, but &amp;#8220;please don&amp;#8217;t take pictures&amp;#8221;. Phones are okay too. The usual complimentary grope as you enter. Random security guards ask &amp;#8220;Where is your ID card?&amp;#8221; at random times. Buses bringing in hordes of people.</description>

      <description>You increase the time from 1.5 hours to 3 hours and give them another chance, of course!
 Keeping in mind the welfare of children and the need for teachers to fill vacancies, the government directed TRB to conduct re-examination for candidates who failed to obtain 60 per cent marks.
The government has directed TRB to increase the duration of the test time from one-and-a-half hours to three hours with additional 30 minutes for blind candidates.</description>

You can find my .vimrc file here. With just this and Vundle setup, I find it much easier to port my settings elsewhere instead of using git.
Hat tip to tecoholic for pushing me to switch to Vundle :)</description>

      <description>When you&amp;#8217;re proxying requests via nginx, you might assume after reading [the documentation][1] that every header is forwarded, except for the Host and Connection headers.
You&amp;#8217;d also be wrong.
nginx drops all headers with an underscore in them.
This is a configurable settings. You can turn it on with a simple
underscores_in_headers on I&amp;#8217;m still baffled as to *why* this is a configuration parameter. And why it is turned off by default.</description>

My first memories of programming aren&amp;#8217;t actually C. They were GW-BASIC, and later on, LOGO. I don&amp;#8217;t remember any of my BASIC &amp;#8211; but I do remember the look on my computer science teacher&amp;#8217;s face in 5th grade when I managed to draw a flower with LOGO when everyone else was doing rectangles and lines. I vividly remember it &amp;#8211; you draw an arc for a certain length, then stop, draw another arc in the reverse direction for the same length &amp;#8211; and you have a petal.</description>

 Moving yuvi.in to my prgmr server. I want wordpress for my blog, but I don&amp;#8217;t want to run MySQL. Solution? Keep blog where it is (with the awesome webfaction people!) and use nginx to proxy requests to blog/. Seems to work, so yay! Rewrote tawp.in to use python/flask/memcached. Available on github. Replaced older node.js version Reading through _The Art of Unix Programming_ on kindle. Amazing book so far.</description>

 Incorporated search results (rather than just suggestions) into the Wikipedia app. Was a slight bitch to get right, but after that have made a bunch of variants that the others are testing out to see which one feels good (Suggestion if exists, else search, or search alone). Took up most of my time. We put out a dud as RC3 for the Wikipedia app.</description>

Talked about yenWikipedia, and learnt a lot about how article selection for offline wikipedia is done. Shot myself in the foot multiple times (over use of empty(), incomplete commit summaries and a tab/spaces issue). I&amp;#8217;m rusty and it is showing.

Added proper i18n for SelectionSifter. Redid FilterRatings page completely. Went through PhoneGap documentation, checked out state of its Photo handling API. Looks good. Checked out patch to official Wikipedia app that adds upload functionality. Needs lot more polish.   </description>

      <description>Just finished reading &amp;#8216;Javascript &amp;#8211; The Good Parts&amp;#8217;. Here is what I learnt:
 I knew jack shit about JavaScript. I was able to get along so far simply because I knew jQuery and understood how closures work. Holy shit that&amp;#8217;s one fucked up language. Quite schizophrenic, saved by almost limitless extensibility/monkey-patchability/watcha-gonna-do-write-a-java-applet-hahaha . If you&amp;#8217;re going to write Javascript, you&amp;#8217;ll have to subset. Subsetting/augmenting has its own share of problems &amp;#8211; primarily that map in your code might not be the same as map in someone else&amp;#8217;s code, even if they seem to be working on the same &amp;#8216;type&amp;#8217; jQuery is incredible.</description>

It&amp;#8217;s a bit like HHG2G &amp;#8211; you don&amp;#8217;t read for the storyline (which is jumbled) but for the characters, wit, rationality and humor. Quite a few of those things hit very close to home &amp;#8211; if you are a geek, they would perhaps to you too. Highly reccomended.

Presenting a reprint from 2006, my interview with Sriram Krishnan, then Microsoftie. Note that the opinions here are of a Sriram 5 years ago, and do not necessarily represent what he thinks now :D And the questions are obviously the questions a younger, naiver (and stupider) Yuvi would&amp;#8217;ve asked, so bear with that.</description>

      <description>I was debugging an issue at work today where a (generated) file refused to download in Chrome, but the same URL worked just fine with wget. I remember reading in the HTTP Spec that HTTP headers can only be lower ASCII, so when wget mangled the output file&amp;#8217;s name, the problem was obvious &amp;#8211; the file name contained a character that wasn&amp;#8217;t in lower ASCII (an accented A). Chrome had borked on encountering it, while wget soldiered on.</description>

      <description>From HN:
 From my experience, the largest hurdle first time programmers have is being able to execute programs in their head. It takes a cognitive leap to go from the source code in front of them, and what happens at runtime.
 (emphasis mine)
I believe that if you have made that cognitive leap, you can call yourself a programmer. It means you&amp;#8217;ve entered into the second hump &amp;#8211; you are a programmer.</description>

I don&amp;#8217;t want any of my children to be punished by God.
 However, it also had this gem of an answer:
 Do not educate them, or expose them to critical thinking, logic or science.
Lie to them constantly about how the world works.</description>

      <description>4Chan isn&amp;#8217;t exactly what you&amp;#8217;d associate with &amp;#8216;shit, that&amp;#8217;s a cool piece of code!&amp;#8217;, but look what I found!
(via HN)
Nice hack. And it is O(N) in bitsize of largest number (Ignoring all the overhead of forking new processes, the problem with the race conditions(Sort 0 and 0.1? How about 0.01 and 0.011?), processor contention, etc,.) They basically delegated the sorting to the process scheduler, treating it as a sort of priority queue.</description>

      <description>May 25-June 13 Loads of things happened.
Finished/polished up ShortUrl. Pending review. Would go into not just tawiki, but possibly all wmf wikis. YAY!
Moved to a dual monitor setup. Dual 23&amp;#8243; Monitors, one Samsung LED and one Acer LCD. Also moved to 8G of RAM. VMs are much less painful now.
Did a few back/forths with the GSoC extension architecture. It&amp;#8217;s still blocking, so working with the non-blocking parts of GSoC now.</description>

      <description>Dear Future Me,
I know you don&amp;#8217;t want to pre-book travel tickets. You tell yourself that you like the sense of adventure and uncertainity that it gives you. You tell yourself that you need these life expriences.
But I know the truth, ofcourse. You&amp;#8217;re just plain ol&amp;#8217; lazy. Too lazy to book your damn tickets. So, get off your ass and book them now. I&amp;#8217;ll promise you that I&amp;#8217;ll hunt you through time and kill you.</description>

      <description>(Update 3: Manish (@jimanish) was awesome enough to point me to the official stuff from Railway Ministry (pdf here). It starts off by stating the cause for the rules being strict:
 A case relating to lapses in allowing shooting of a feature film (which resulted inburning/damage of some passenger coaches provided to the party causing a huge loss tothe Railways)
 It then notes that it&amp;#8217;s archaic, since you can even shoot from mobile phones, etc.</description>

      <description>Update: As usual, good comments at HN.
I&amp;#8217;ve been trying to put it in words for a while, and failing utterly every time. swombat gets to the crux of it wonderfully:
 At the same time, something really bothered me about my work. It felt pointless. One project I did (whose output was basically a PPT and Word document outlining the successes and failures of a client project), which took two and a half months, had, as its only apparent purpose, the promotion of the person who had led the project.</description>

Ofcourse, someone should write a post called &amp;#8220;CS, EC or EEE?&amp;#8221; &amp;#8220;Neither&amp;#8221; for high school students, because for a lot of people the answer to the question &amp;#8220;Should you do Engineering?&amp;#8221; is a huge &amp;#8220;No&amp;#8221;.
The comments section is even more awesome. Choice quotes:

      <description>Very late one. I&amp;#8217;ve been using this since last September (as those of you on twitter and following me would know).
It was on 2.1 for a long, long time &amp;#8211; and even after 2.2 came out (first unofficially and then officially) I didn&amp;#8217;t upgrade for almost a month (thanks to a missing usb cable and some laziness). I then upgraded to official 2.2, then one of the &amp;#8216;Stock&amp;#8217; bootloaderless ROMs, and then to InDroid 3.</description>

After several close calls, I&amp;#8217;m officially moving from HiSlain back to WordPress. I just don&amp;#8217;t have enough time to maintain all the things I wanted in a blog platform in HiSlain, hence the move back. However, it satisfied it&amp;#8217;s purpose &amp;#8211; I learnt to write code I could use, others could use, and others could contribute to.</description>

I&amp;#8217;ve moved across several blogging platforms and urls in the meantime (Blogspot, wordpress and now my own custom engine. I&amp;#8217;ve sadly lost a good portion of my blogs thanks to a domain loss and a server crash. Sigh.

I just wrote my first brainfuck program. Might as well be my last, but not sure. Tape-based turing-ish programing seems fun, so maybe I&amp;#8217;ll try that again with something more expressive than brainfuck (or maybe that is pointless?)
And I&amp;#8217;m doing the SICP Exercises. In MIT-Scheme. I&amp;#8217;ve put them up on GitHub.</description>

I don&amp;#8217;t quite like the actual way the subject is taught &amp;#8211; mind numbing, error prone calculations with a calculator. However, the methods are pretty awesome.
The staff explained Gauss Seidel yesterday, and it seemed a straightforward recursive solution to me. So in the break, I cooked up a small python script that gave me all the intermediate answers as well &amp;#8211; so for any assignments I could just run them through this and copy it to paper.</description>

      <description>&amp;#8220;Why does Cheese have a maximum photo count of 100 in burst mode?&amp;#8221; questions have popped up quite a few times on the cheese list. It is just a teeny, tiny bug &amp;#8211; fixed in master.
The work around is simple:
Till Cheese 2.32
Raise it to whatever value you want in line 8 of /usr/share/cheese/cheese-prefs.ui.
(If you don&amp;#8217;t know what version you are running, check Help -&amp;gt; About)
(Fix is just raising the limit from 100 to something that most people will likely not hit.</description>

 Lack of binary packages. I had to build quite a few packages from source because there were no binary packages available. The tilting point was when I figured there were no binary packges for mit-scheme!</description>

      <description>I&amp;#8217;m blogging from Arch Linux :D
I&amp;#8217;ve been meaning to setup Arch on my netbook for a while, after hearing a lot of people rave about how awesome pacman is and how fast their system is. I didn&amp;#8217;t want to spend time on moving to a new distro during my GSoC, so I kept putting it off. Yesterday Ubuntu borked on my netbook for some weird reason (I suspect it was my friend Rathna sitting on it, but might have been because I was thinking of moving to Vim too) &amp;#8211; and I took the opportunity to install Arch.</description>

      <description>So, I now have a motorbike!
It&amp;#8217;s a Bajaj Platina, and bought off GSoC money from my cousin Sudar. I&amp;#8217;ve been learning to ride for a while, and it&amp;#8217;s been good. Had my first accident a while back, and started riding again a few days back.
I&amp;#8217;m still very conscious about riding. I still think before clutching, braking, changing gears, etc. It hasn&amp;#8217;t been internalized in the same way typing on a Keyboard has been &amp;#8211; with enough practice (and accidents!</description>

      <description>Google Summer of Code ended a while back. Me (and most on #gsoc) agreed on one thing &amp;#8211; WHERE DID THOSE 3 MONTHS GO? Amazing time it was &amp;#8211; thanks to _ke (Who is frolicking somewhere in Thailand right now), fargiolas and the rest of the GNOME guys (#clutter, #gstreamer and #gtk+ yay!) for making it awesome. #hackers-india was a great venting place too :)
Cheese&amp;#8216;s master needs quite a bit of work before it can be included in GNOME 3.</description>

 recognize that work is something you do to live and isn&amp;#8217;t your whole life
 Let&amp;#8217;s examine this as objectively as we can manage. Lets assume a 40 hour work week where the employer pays for lunch, as the employer should be doing, which results in a real 8 hour day instead of a 9 hour day. Of course a 9 hour day will work even more in favor of my argument.</description>

      <description>If you had read my Cheese GSoC proposal, it would&amp;#8217;ve stressed on one major point &amp;#8211; make Cheese sexy.
Two days ago, one of my classmates spent 5 minutes on the bus using Cheese and trying out different effects (and poses!). Today, my brother spent 20 minutes trying to get the perfect combination of style and vagueness for his Facebook profile picture &amp;#8211; using Cheese. He then asked me to create an account for him in Ubuntu (he was an exclusively Win7 user till then) before leaving.</description>

      <description>I used gist to publish my GSoC proposal. Diffs, easy to show off, and Markdown support &amp;#8211; made gist perfect for me to make modifications and get feedback easily.
It is the first &amp;#8216;real&amp;#8217; document I&amp;#8217;ve written &amp;#8211; it actually had a tangible effect.
Now that I don&amp;#8217;t need to make any modifications, I&amp;#8217;ve moved it to my site.</description>

 Performance enhancements. Sacrificed some startup time for much improved usage time. Viewing live effects are now a snap. So is selecting an effect. We went in some cases from ~15s to &amp;lt;1s. Thanks to Tester (and other folks) at #gstreamer for helping out :) Paging of effects. Effects are now in pages of 9 each, instead of a huge scroller area. Applying effects without stopping the pipeline.</description>

Last week&amp;#8230;
 Video Effects file format reader Live Preview of Effects! (YAY!) Effect files added  Live Preview took most of my time. We bought down CPU usage from ~90% to a more manageable ~50%. Cleaned up code a bit (still needs more cleanup). It is rather very &amp;#8216;demoable&amp;#8217;, provided you gloss over the slowdowns.

Last week&amp;#8230;
 Countdown Animations (Thanks to _ke for cleanup!) GConf Cleanup  Yes, that was it.

 Moved code from Github to GNOME Git (Thanks fargiolas!) Learnt how to use GTKBuilder, and how to autoconnect signals to vala callback functions. Learnt some of the intricacies of Gtk+ Layouts (They still have a lot to teach me!) Got a very basic version of the basic Cheese window up and running. Learnt how to embed Clutter into the Gtk+ base of Cheese.</description>

I spent quite a some time today trying to get GTKBuilder to automagically connect all my signals to their handlers. I tripped up at a few places, and so recording them here for posterity.
 If you are using instance methods (like most of us are), you&amp;#8217;ve to decorate your handler function with the attribute [CCode (instance_pos=-1)].</description>

      <description>Quoting from Steven Levy&amp;#8216;s Hackers:
 [..] a project undertaken or a product built not solely to fulfill
some constructive goal, but with some wild pleasure taken in mere
involvement, was called a &amp;#8220;hack.&amp;#8221;
 Building things for the fun of building them is hacking. And hacking is not illegally breaking into computers.
I like hacking. I want to be a real hacker. I can&amp;#8217;t call myself one yet.

Jules Verne&amp;#8217;s Adventures of a Special Correspondent was the first one I completed. It is a good book &amp;#8211; but not phenomenal. It does have a few very good moments, and one of them hit extremely close to home.

      <title>Measure of Learning: Epiphanies per Session</title>

      <description>The measure of code quality is WTFs/minute.
I just realized, after a rather intriguing facebook conversation with Shiva, that the only true measure of learning is Epiphanies per Session.
My latest Epiphany was a couple of days back. And the one before that was a month or so back, when I was &amp;#8216;pairing&amp;#8217; with Sid. I think the one before that was quite some time back &amp;#8211; when I understood the true meaning of closures.</description>

      <description>I was writing a post on how 2009 ended. Here is the tl;dr version: It was my &amp;#8216;growing-up&amp;#8217; year in Tech, and &amp;#8216;roller-coaster&amp;#8217; year in personal stuff. There! I&amp;#8217;m certainly significantly wiser at the end of 2009, and that is due more to my state at the beginning of 2009 than at the end :) Good enough
So how did I celebrate? By joining the KPP competition at Kurukshetra. That&amp;#8217;s what I did at around 12 on New Year&amp;#8217;s.</description>

      <title>The Python Workshop</title>

      <description>We had a python workshop at college a week back.
One hellova workshop it was! Kausik conducted it, and about 14 people turned up (We picked 15, one girl had to miss it &amp;#8216;coz of fever). Every single one of them was there because they wanted to be there. This happened during semester holidays, so they came to college just for this. And from the feedback (and the actions that followed it) I got, it was worth their while.</description>

      <description>Commitment.
I keep jumping around. My GitHub profile is proof for that. So are the large number of projects I&amp;#8217;ve taken up only to leave in the middle. Unless and until I fix my commitment issues, I&amp;#8217;ll be just-another-guy-who-learnt-to-code-in-his-teens, not the-guy-who-changed-the-world. Just reading a lot of stuff isn&amp;#8217;t going to do me any good unless I actually get off my ass and do something.
Hopefully, putting this up in public will make it more real.</description>

      <description>Here is an approximate timeline of the editors I&amp;#8217;ve used so far:
 Turbo C++ (4th grade to 8th grade) Visual Basic 6 (8th grade to 10th grade) Visual Studio 2005 (10th grade to 11th grade) Visual Studio 2008 (11th grade to 1st year of college) gVim (1st year of college) GNU Emacs (after gVim)  Now, the one thing, maybe even the only thing I miss is the fact that gVim gives me the I-Bar cursor, while Emacs by default gave me the block cursor.</description>

And my phone doesn&amp;#8217;t work.
Then I find out my Internet doesn&amp;#8217;t work.
Then I find my TV&amp;#8217;s crapped.
Then I find that I&amp;#8217;ve to go to college tomorrow.
The last thing is good. The others aren&amp;#8217;t. Oh well.</description>

      <description>One of the (good) things that came out of the IIT Hackfest was me hanging out on the #hackers-india IRC channel. It is wild, swingy and usually fun. Usually.
So yesterday night, ideamonk casually mentioned that he was working on something called pymos. It was a python script that made mosiacs. Now that was something I was totally interested in &amp;#8211; I tried making a similar &amp;#8216;script&amp;#8217; a long time back (in C#), and totally utterly failed, simply because I was so caught up with the part that downloaded pictures from flickr that I didn&amp;#8217;t do the part that generated the actual Mosaic.</description>

      <title>Why I got rid of my fork of Waffle</title>

      <description>For those of you who didn&amp;#8217;t know, Waffle is a schemaless storage layer that sits on top of SQLAlchemy. Something that I was initially very interested in.
Not anymore.
Why?
Because I found MongoDB.
And fell in love.
Yes, I do know they both are different, but MongoDB has the things that attracted me to Waffle (very flexible schema, great querying, indexes) and is just as easy to set up (maybe not as easy as Waffle over SQLite, but only slightly less easier).</description>

      <description>I was about to just type a list of stuff here, but that doesn&amp;#8217;t do the topic justice. So here I am, at 3:30 in the morning, sleep cycle screwed up by the Hackfest, typing out a post on what all I learnt from there. I spent pretty much my entire awake-time at the IIT, so it helped me a lot.
Your college doesn&amp;#8217;t matter much IIT Envy. Every non-IITian has that.</description>

Probably pass out in front of the computers :)
I&amp;#8217;ll be hackin on GNOME Apps &amp;#8211; hopefully Banshee (since that&amp;#8217;s one app I love), or write a newish, smallish app with PyGTK.</description>

      <description>Document Everything! On paper. Will save you from hell later.  There is never enough time. Start earlier than you think is early enough. Sell people things. Make them want it. Think from their point of view. Prioritize. Delegate. Responsibly. And follow up. Know when to stop. Recognize when something is good enough. Printing takes a long time. Very long timeE. And is boring. People often do not mean what they say.</description>

I&amp;#8217;m liking it so far &amp;#8211; 7 hours of code yesterday, along with 2 blog posts. Couldn&amp;#8217;t hit my code target today &amp;#8211; but am hitting my blog target. I should figure out more ways to make this work better.</description>

Her waitress uniform made her look cuter than ever. He knew he had to ask her out. He drummed up enough courage, went to her and said &amp;#8216;Hi&amp;#8217;.
She turned, gave him a cute smile, and replied &amp;#8216;Hello uncle, what can I do for you?</description>

      <description>I dig KrishAshok&amp;#8216;s writing. Been lurking there for a long time.
Only problem is, he doesn&amp;#8217;t write often. Nor does he tweet often.
Only solution is, ofcourse, to create a bot that writes like him, and another bot that tweets like him.
UPDATE: Some of my favorites: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, etc. Too many to list :)

He moved out of the campus, and saw sixty thousand other people. He still felt alone. He realized the problem is not the world, but him. Within the next few hours, the problem went away.</description>

So I ran Freya&amp;#8217;s Blog through a markov chain text generator, and it came up with a ton of potentially funny quotes that had me in splits for a while. Here are the best:
 They say its gonna kill me But still, his eyes are in no way good. Thank God I never pick it up. But hello, which parent accompanies a full-grown daughter to her lover When you win, nobody knows that she&amp;#8217;s thinking of marriage.</description>

Nothing fancy &amp;#8211; just uses Pygments, but the process of modifying the plugin architecture to support this has been an awesome ride. I&amp;#8217;ll probably open up a new GitHub project just for HiSlain Themes and Plugins.

We walk along the sides of a typical city street. She is talking &amp;#8211; she always is. When has she ever been quiet? Quiet is an adjective one doesn&amp;#8217;t use with the noun &amp;#8216;girl&amp;#8217;. And she&amp;#8217;s no ordinary girl.</description>

Not bad, eh?

      <description>Should I tell her?
I shouldn&amp;#8217;t.
I don&amp;#8217;t even know her. She&amp;#8217;s new in class. So am I. We&amp;#8217;re all new in this class. We are first years, at the first day of college.
I don&amp;#8217;t even know her name! And she obviously doesn&amp;#8217;t know my name. We are, for all intents and purposes, complete strangers in the same class.
What if she takes it seriously? I&amp;#8217;ll probably be branded the classholic flirt of the class, and never be taken seriously ever again.</description>

      <description>He was coding.
He was on a bus, and coding. He had bought himself a cute little black Netbook just so he could open up Vim on a bus and code Python. He is a geek. A young, 18 year old typical geek. As typical as your usual geek.
The bus was quite empty. It was late at night, this was proably the last bus for the day, and except the Driver &amp;amp; Conductor, there were probably 4 people on the bus.</description>

      <description>I&amp;#8217;m Yuvi. This is my second blog. My old one has been retired because, well, it&amp;#8217;s old! It contained too much ranting. It has content from me since I was 14 &amp;#8211; a lot of that is just plain stupid, and a few are even embarassingly inaccurate &amp;amp; naive. You can still possibly checkout the old blog &amp;#8211; if I manage to get the content back :)
This new blog will be about me.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Life</title>

      <description>Geeks Optimize Life. True that. I do optimize the short route from when I get down from my college bus to my home, and me and Sudar did have an argument about optimization when we took the train together one day. My argument was that the distance you are going to walk is constant anyway (you either walk it at the station you are boarding the train, or where you are getting down), so moving to the extreme end of the train is pointless.</description>
