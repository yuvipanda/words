      <p>I am trying to find a nice way to keep thoughts, ideas and notes outside my head for a few months now.
I worked my way through many applications, trying to use the system they promote as the basis for my own. Along the journey, I got a better sense of what was important to me in such an application. I&rsquo;ll walk through the various applications I&rsquo;ve tried, along with the criteria I&rsquo;ve developed by the end</p>
<h2 id="evernote">Evernote</h2>
<p>First stop, big one. I already had misgivings about it being from a large corporation. I still paid for it, and tested it out for a few months.</p>
<ul>
<li>No markdown support. This immediately became a problem - I had no idea how much I&rsquo;ve come to expect markdown wherever I type. They have been <a href="https://discussion.evernote.com/topic/118932-native-markdown-support/">asked for markdown support</a> many times, but I don&rsquo;t think this is ever going to happen. I realized that <strong>markdown support is a minimum requirement</strong> for me</li>
<li>Conflict resolution when I edited the same note in multiple places was really terrible. Completely unusable. I&rsquo;ve 3 devices I use regularly - an iPad Pro, a Macbook and my Android Phone. Through this experience I discovered that <strong>proper cross-device syncing is very important</strong> for me as well.</li>
<li>I paid Evernote so I could work offline. I already have a lot of anxiety about not having internet access (a topic for another post), and didn&rsquo;t want to not have access to these if I don&rsquo;t have internet access. This wasn&rsquo;t very good thanks to the shitty conflict resolution, but the process made me realize that I cared a lot about <strong>full offline availability</strong></li>
<li>I also hated the UI. It was clunky, had way too many options, and none of the options I really wanted.</li>
<li>There was no way to link notes together I found. I realized that my time at wikimedia had made me very accustomed to hyperlinking as a way of writing. Evernote had no clear affordances for doing this. So <strong>hyperlinking</strong> became important to me. I could also smile at the big impact Wikimedia has had on the way I think :D This was the beginning of me recognizing that a purely hierarchical setup might not work for me&hellip;</li>
</ul>
<p>I noticed I was using Evernote less and less, and wandered the desert for a while.</p>
<h2 id="onenote">OneNote</h2>
<p>I had been using OneNote on and off for a while. It has some of the same problems Evernote has. But the absolute no-go for me was how it handled text notes on my laptop.</p>
<p><img src="/images/note-taking/onenote-terrible.png" alt="one note being terrible"></p>
<p>This <strong>feature</strong> killed it. It was too much mental load, and I hated the extra UI it brought. It had most of the problems evernote did, and worse.</p>
<h2 id="list-applications">List applications</h2>
<p>At this point, I read some parts of <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1633.Getting_Things_Done">Getting Things Done</a> again, trying to control my sprawling, anxiety-filled work life. It was useful, as always, but mostly to remind me to <strong>not use my brain to store data</strong>.</p>
<p>I then spent a bunch of time bouncing between different <strong>todo list apps</strong>, as a way to get stuff out of my brain and into a list. Learning about <a href="https://www.becktench.com/blog/2019/5/13/kinder-to-do-lists">kinder todo lists</a> was very helpful.</p>
<p>I tried a lot of these apps - Google Keep, <a href="https://www.nirvanahq.com/">Nirvana</a>, Evernote / OneNote, <a href="https://ticktick.com/">TickTick</a>. Nothing really clicked, but eventually I ended up on <a href="https://todoist.com/app/">Todoist</a>. The app was great, sync worked fine, and my flatmate also used it. Boom!</p>
<p>I was still looking for a note-taking app, which I considered quite distinct from the todo list apps. I was also finding the fixed format of todoist a bit limiting. I wanted each of my Projects to have a criteria of &lsquo;this is now done&rsquo;, but there wasn&rsquo;t an easy way to do that in Todoist. The importance given to due dates was also nagging, and gave me anxiety.</p>
<h2 id="inkdrophttpswwwinkdropapp"><a href="https://www.inkdrop.app/">Inkdrop</a></h2>
<p>Looking for cross-device markdown note taking apps led me to Inkdrop. Built by a single indie dev, <a href="https://my.inkdrop.app/plugins">has lots of plugins</a>, and looked quite nice. I started using it and quite liked it in the beginning. It has a <a href="https://my.inkdrop.app/plugins/vim">vim plugin</a> which is an absolute requirement for me if I&rsquo;m going to be writing a lot of text (or so I thought)
However, I found I wasn&rsquo;t using it as much. It had all the features I thought I wanted, but somehow it wasn&rsquo;t quite fitting the mental model I had.</p>
<h2 id="outliners">Outliners</h2>
<p>At this point, I heard about <a href="https://roamresearch.com/">Roam Research</a>. It looked really neat, and was quite different from the other note taking apps. I had always dismissed <a href="https://orgmode.org/">org-mode</a> for its emacs-centrism, but this made me reconsider that. However, it was in closed beta, so I let it be. I&rsquo;ll definitely re-visit it, especially if it has a good offline story.</p>
<p>I looked around for alternatives, and discovered <a href="https://workflowy.com/">workflowey</a>. I&rsquo;ll admit the list of endorsements on their home page was a big draw for me.
However, when I tried to sign up, I got</p>
<p><img src="/images/note-taking/workflowey-password.jpg" alt="one note being terrible"></p>
<p>My usual password length is 63, and it totally <a href="https://twitter.com/WorkFlowy/status/1261034917011632128">failed that test</a>. I also discovered <a href="https://workflowy.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/community/posts/360007921026-Needs-some-kind-of-Markdown-syntax-support-">they don&rsquo;t support markdown</a> so that rules them out</p>
<h2 id="dynalist">Dynalist</h2>
<p>I discovered <strong><a href="https://dynalist.io/">Dynalist</a></strong> as a Workflowey alternative. It has all the things I want, and I&rsquo;ve been using it for a few days now. It&rsquo;s been extremely awesome! The syncing is flakey, and I have some anxiety about losing data - but otherwise, the format itself has been great for me!</p>
<p>So what I&rsquo;ve realized is that I don&rsquo;t want a note taking app, <strong>I wanted an outliner</strong>. Outliners seem to match how my brain works much better than purely hierarchical note taking apps. I can take notes without having to worry about organizing them first, and then organize them afterwards as I see fit. Very low mental overhad between what is in my brain and what&rsquo;s on the screen. I like it.</p>
<p>I hope I can replace todoist with Dynalist too. I&rsquo;ll experiment with it later. But for now, &lt;3 dynalist. This blog post was written in dynalist, then edited in <a href="https://typora.io/">typora</a>. Not bad.</p>
<h2 id="evaluation-criteria">Evaluation criteria</h2>
<p>In the end, looks like I have these needs when it comes to outliners / note taking apps.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Markdown support, ideally with something like <a href="https://katex.org/">KaTeX</a> or <a href="https://www.mathjax.org/">MathJax</a> support</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cross-device sync across platforms (Mac, iPad, Android)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Full offline support, with sync that doesn&rsquo;t lose data</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ability to hyperlink different parts of the system</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I&rsquo;ll look at Roam research later, but for now, I&rsquo;m enjoying having a note taking system that matches how my brain seems to think.</p>
<h2 id="credits">Credits</h2>
<p>Lots of good conversations about this in various places with <a href="https://www.deobald.ca/">Steve Deobald</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/prxtl">Pratul Kalia</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/robla">Robla</a>, <a href="https://prtksxna.com/">Prateek</a>, <a href="https://ankursethi.in/">Ankur Sethi</a> and many others who I am clearly forgetting.</p>
