<p>If I unfollowed you, don&rsquo;t take it personally! DM me for a phone number you can use for Signal / WhatsApp / Telegram - that&rsquo;s how 90% of my social activities seem to happen these days anyway.</p>
<p>h/t to <a href="http://www.gaijin.com/">Jorm</a> for the idea of targetted following!</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: I&rsquo;ve also setup <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/leechblock/">LeechBlock</a> to only allow me 5mins of Twitter every 2h, and I don&rsquo;t have the twitter app on my phone. I wish there was a leechblock type thing for my Phone tho.</p>
