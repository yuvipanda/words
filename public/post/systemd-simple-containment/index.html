			 	<h1>systemd simple containment for GUI applications &amp; shells</h1>
			  <span class="post-date">Fri, Mar 31, 2017</span>
			      <p>I earlier had <a href="http://words.yuvi.in/post/systemd-gui-applications/">a vaguely working setup</a> for making sure browsers, shells and other applications don&rsquo;t eat all RAM / CPU on my machine with systemd + sudo + shell scripts.</p>

<p>It was a hacky solution, and also had complications when used to launch shells. It wasn&rsquo;t passing in all the environment varialbes it should, causing interesting-to-debug issues. <code>sudo</code> rules were complex, and hard to do securely.</p>

<p>I had also been looking for an excuse to learn more Golang, so I ended up writing <a href="https://github.com/yuvipanda/systemd-simple-containment"><code>systemd-simple-containment</code></a> or <code>ssc</code>.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a simple golang application that produces a binary that can be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Setuid"><code>setuid</code></a> to <code>root</code>, and thus get around all our <code>sudo</code> complexity, at the price of having to be very, very careful about the code. Fortunately, it&rsquo;s short enough (~100 lines) and <code>systemd-run</code> helps it keep the following invariants:</p>

<ol>
<li>It will never spawn any executable as any user other than the &lsquo;real&rsquo; uid / gid of the user calling the binary.</li>
<li>It doesn&rsquo;t allow arbitrary systemd <code>properties</code> to be set, ensuring a more limited attack surface.</li>
</ol>

<p>However, this is the first time I&rsquo;m playing with setuid and with Go, so I probably fucked something up. I feel ok enough about my understanding of real and effective uids for now to use it myself, but not to recommend it to other people. Hopefully I&rsquo;ll be confident enough say that soon :)</p>

<p>By using a real programming language, I also easily get commandline flags for sharing tty or not (so I can use the same program for launching GUI &amp; interactive terminal applications), pass all environment variables through (which can&rsquo;t be just standard child inheritence, since <code>systemd-run</code> doesn&rsquo;t work that way) &amp; the ability to setuid (you can&rsquo;t do that easily to a script).</p>

<p>I was sure I&rsquo;d hate writing go because of the constant <code>if err != nil</code> checks, but it hasn&rsquo;t bothered me that much. I would like to write more Go, to get a better feel for it. This code is too short to like a language, but I definitely hate it less :)</p>

<p>Anyway, now I can launch GUI applications with <code>ssc -tty=false -isolation=strict firefox</code> and it does the right thing. I currently have available <code>-isolation=strict</code> and <code>-isolation=relaxed</code>, the former performing stronger sandboxing (NoNewPrivileges, PrivateTmp) than the latter (just MemoryMax). i&rsquo;ll slowly add more protections here, but just keep two modes (ideally).</p>

<p>My Gnome Terminal shell command is now <code>ssc -isolation=relaxed /bin/bash -i</code> and it works great :)</p>

<p>I am pretty happy with <code>ssc</code> as it exists now. Only thing I now want to do is to be able to use it from the GNOME launcher (I am using GNOME3 with gnome-shell). Apparently <em>shortcuts</em> are no longer cool and hence pretty hard to create in modern desktop environments :| I shall keep digging!</p>
