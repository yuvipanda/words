<p>I have enjoyed keeping running logs of my coding work (devlogs)
in the past, and am going to start doing those again now.</p>

<p>This &lsquo;holiday&rsquo; season, I am spending time teaching myself
skills I sortof know about but do not have a deep understanding of.</p>

<h2 id="jupyterlab-extension">JupyterLab extension</h2>

<p>I spent the first part of the day (before I started devlogging)
working on finishing up a <a href="https://github.com/yuvipanda/jupyterlab-nbmetadata">jupyterlab extension</a>
I started the day before. It lets you <a href="https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/issues/1308">edit notebook metadata</a>.
I got started since I wanted to use <a href="https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext">Jupytext</a>
for my work on publishing <a href="https://github.com/yuvipanda/mybinder.org-analytics">mybinder.org-analytics</a>.</p>

<p>TypeScript was easy to pick up coming from C#. I wish the
phospor / JupyterLab code had more documentation though.</p>

<p>I ran into <a href="https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/issues/5802">a bug</a>.
While following instructions to set up a JupyterLab dev
setup, I somehow managed to <a href="https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/issues/5803">delete my source code</a>.
Thankfully I got most of it back thanks to a saved copy
in vscode. It was a sour start to the morning though.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll get back on to this once the sour taste is gone,
and hopefully the bug is fixed :)</p>

<h2 id="asyncio-what-s-next-yuri-selivanov-pybay-2018">asyncio: what&rsquo;s next | Yuri Selivanov @ PyBay 2018</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been trying to get a better handle on asyncio. I can
use it, but I don&rsquo;t fully understand it - I am probably leaving
bugs everywhere&hellip;</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/vem5GHboRNM" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<p>From one of the asyncio maintainers. Gave me some impetus
to <a href="https://github.com/jupyter/repo2docker/pull/539">push the default version of Python</a> on mybinder.org to 3.7 :D
I&rsquo;m most excited about getting features from Trio &amp; Curio into
the standard library. Was good to hear that nobody can quite
figure out exception handling, and not just me.</p>

<p>I discovered <a href="https://github.com/observerss/aioutils">aioutils</a>
while searching around after this. I&rsquo;ve copy pasted code that
theoretically does the same things as <code>Group</code> and <code>Pool</code> from
<code>aioutils</code>, but I&rsquo;ve no idea if they are right. I&rsquo;ll be using
this library from now!</p>

<h2 id="processing-signals">Processing Signals</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;m writing a simple process supervisor library to replace the
janky parts of nbserverproxy. It should have the following
features:</p>

<ol>
<li>Restart processes when they die</li>
<li>Propagate signals appropriately</li>
<li>Support a sense of &lsquo;readiness&rsquo; probes (not liveness)</li>
<li>Be very well tested</li>
<li>Run on asyncio</li>
</ol>

<p>This is more difficult than it seems, and am slowly working my
way through it. (1) isn&rsquo;t too difficult.</p>

<p>(2) is a fair bit more difficult. <code>atexit</code> is useless since it doesn&rsquo;t do
anything with SIGTERM. So I need to manage my own SIGTERM
handlers. However, this means there needs to be a centralish
location of some sort that decides <em>when</em> to exit. This introduces
global state, and I don&rsquo;t like that at all. But unix signals are
global, and maybe there&rsquo;s nothing for me to do here.</p>

<p>I initially created a Supervisor class that holds a bunch of
SupervisedProcess&rsquo;s, but it was still calling sys.exit in it.
Since signals are global, I realize there&rsquo;s no other real
way to handle this, and so I made a global handler setup too.
This has the additional advantage of being able to remove
handlers when a SupervisedProcess dies, avoiding memory
leaks and stuff.</p>

<p>Testing this stuff is hard!</p>

<p>I also need to make sure I don&rsquo;t end up with lots of races.
I&rsquo;m still writing concurrent code, even without threads.
Gotta be careefull. Especially with signals thrown in. Although
I guess once you get a SIGTERM or SIGINT inconsistent state
is not particularly worrysome.</p>
