<h2 id="physical-activity">Physical activity</h2>

<p>I walked for about 6 miles yesterday evening, after doing 3-4 miles each day for about 2-3 days before. The roads were empty, and it was lovely. I&rsquo;ve listened to maybe 6-10 hours of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deborah_Frances-White">Deborah Frances-White</a> in the last week or so, split between <a href="http://guiltyfeminist.com/">The Guilty Feminist</a> and <a href="http://globalpillage.net/">Global Pillage</a>. Next time though, I&rsquo;m going to try listen to podcasts less &amp; observe my surroundings more. I am doing this (plus PT) to rehab my knee mostly. I slept for 12h yesterday night :)</p>

<h2 id="asyncio-deadlock">Asyncio deadlock</h2>

<p>I don&rsquo;t have enough experience with the pitfalls of concurrent programming where you <em>have</em> to use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-sync.html">synchronization</a> techniques. I had my first deadlock today, and after a few minutes realized it was actually an infinite recursion from a typo. I need to get a better theoretical understanding of both event loop based async programming and synchronization methods. I&rsquo;ve used them with threading &amp; Java, but feel shaky in asyncio.</p>

<p>simperviser now has 100% unit test coverage. But it combines asyncio,
processes &amp; signals - so that doesn&rsquo;t give me enough confidence as it might have otherwise. I&rsquo;ll take it though :)</p>

<h2 id="vscode-customization">VSCode customization</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been re-reading the pragmatic programmer again (after initially reading it about 12 years or so ago). A lot of it still holds up, although some stuff is date (love for Broken Window policing &amp; perl). It reminded me that I hadn&rsquo;t really spent much time customizing and being more productive in VSCode, so am spending time today doing that.</p>

<p>I switch between vscode and my terminal quite a bit, mostly for git operations and running tests. I&rsquo;m going to see if I can stay inside vscode comfortably for running pytest based tests.</p>

<p>It made me very sad that the only thing I wanted from the pytest integration in vscode is something the maintainers aren&rsquo;t actively working on - <a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-python/issues/637">shortcut to run test the cursor is currently at</a>. I also can&rsquo;t seem
to see test output directly.</p>

<p>I think I&rsquo;ll be using the Terminal for pytest runs for now. I&rsquo;m not even going to try with git.</p>

<p>If I was younger and not already full of projects to do, I&rsquo;d have picked up and tried to make a PR for this. Boo time commitments.</p>

<h2 id="readyness-check">Readyness check</h2>

<p>I rallied late in the day &amp; wrote some code around readyness checks in simpervisor. I don&rsquo;t fully understand what I want it to do, but I&rsquo;m going to look at what kubernetes does &amp; try to follow that. Since this is being written for nbserverproxy, I am also going to try port nbserverproxy to simpervisor to see what kind of API affordances I&rsquo;m missing. Primarily, I feel there should be a lock somewhere, but:</p>

<ol>
<li>I don&rsquo;t have a unified theory of what needs locking &amp; why</li>
<li>I don&rsquo;t know if I need a lock or another synchronization mechanism</li>
<li>I don&rsquo;t know how it&rsquo;ll actually be used by the application</li>
</ol>

<p>So designing by porting nbserverproxy seems right.</p>
