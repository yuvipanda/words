  <p>He was sitting in class. Bored. He looked around. He saw sixty other people, but felt alone. He stood up, shouted &#8216;Why am I here?!? This won&#8217;t do!&#8217; and walked out of the class, leaving everyone confused and weirded out.</p>

<p>He moved out of the campus, and saw sixty thousand other people. He still felt alone. He realized the problem is not the world, but him. Within the next few hours, the problem went away. Forever.</p>

  <p>The bus lurched to one side, and fell of the bridge. He felt his skull crack. He realized he had just seconds to live. One hand immobilized, he used the other to find the mobile. Two well practiced presses later, he was at the <code>Compose Message</code> screen. Five seconds later, he had the words &#8216;love ya&#8217; typed out. He hit send, and died peacefully.</p>

<p>Five second later, an error popped up on the screen. <code>Unable to send message. Retry?</code>. He wasn&#8217;t alive to press <code>Yes</code>.</p>

  <p>I love autogenerating text.</p>

<p>So I ran <a href="http://www.freya.in/">Freya&#8217;s Blog</a> through a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain">markov chain</a> text generator, and it came up with a ton of potentially funny quotes that had me in splits for a while. Here are the best:</p>

<ol>
<li>They say its gonna kill me</li>
<li>But still, his eyes are in no way good.</li>
<li>Thank God I never pick it up.</li>
<li>But hello, which parent accompanies a full-grown daughter to her lover</li>
<li>When you win, nobody knows that she&#8217;s thinking of marriage.</li>
<li>He&#8217;ll persuade me somewhow and then copy-paste this.</li>
<li>And I&#8217;m blogging with a heavy suitcase full of new clothes (which aren&#8217;t really comfortable and I wasn&#8217;t flat-chested) but not sweet! Um..well..the dress isn&#8217;t bad but I was embarrassed.</li>
<li>My Friend deserves better, so finally we&#8217;re here in the future.</li>
<li>I didn&#8217;t want Economics, so they grow, safely and sweetly blossoming. By this time, the camera broke.</li>
<li>It broke because, well, he was gorgeous!</li>
<li>Considering the fact that I would&#8217;ve sat without realising that 59 people registered for the ball, gowns etc. But that&#8217;s very few blogs.</li>
<li>Her reason ultimately was, you don&#8217;t really like the designs. But that&#8217;s what women want for being in a relatioship.</li>
<li>If a women got molested, then she finally said &#8220;Okay, dear, I will have to pay so far and she still lurves him</li>
<li>That&#8217;s stupid.</li>
<li>If anyone has the official cleavage showing license, I don&#8217;t. Now, it&#8217;s not falling.</li>
</ol>

<p>I swear these are all authentic computer produced text, and I think they <em>do</em> have a &#8216;freya&#8217; feel to them. Don&#8217;t they?</p>

<p>Now, if there&#8217;s enough interest, I might even make this into a website, that throws you a quote everytime you hit it :P Or maybe I should target some other blogger? (/me eyes <a href="http://sathyanarain.com">Sathya</a>)</p>

  <p>I&#8217;ve been hacking &#8217;round with <a href="http://github.com/yuvipanda/HiSlain">HiSlain</a>, and wrote a syntax highlighting plugin for it. Nothing fancy &#8211; just uses <a href="http://pygments.org">Pygments</a>, but the process of modifying the plugin architecture to support this has been an awesome ride. I&#8217;ll probably open up a new GitHub project just for HiSlain Themes and Plugins.</p>

<p>And since I&#8217;ve to test out Syntax Highlighting,</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve got the plugin infrastructure (mostly) in. Google Analytics Plugin and the RSS link plugin are working :)</p>

<p>Next Step is to make <a href="http://disqus.com">DISQUS</a> a plugin too, and then I can start on porting themes!</p>

<p>I can&#8217;t. :(</p>

</p>
  </header>
  <p>I promise her &#8216;the Treat of a Lifetime&#8217;. I cook up a reason realistic enough for her to buy it. I bribe off everyone else to make sure she is alone. And she is.</p>

<p>We walk along the sides of a typical city street. She is talking &#8211; she always is. When has she ever been quiet? Quiet is an adjective one doesn&#8217;t use with the noun &#8216;girl&#8217;. And she&#8217;s no ordinary girl. She is my girl. Atleast, I hope she will be. I hope to know in a few hours.</p>

<p>Pizza Hut is in sight. She expects me to take her there. But I don&#8217;t. I take her hand in mine and take a right turn, into a broken down building. She is surprised, but does not resist.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why hiding? Any of your relatives passing by?&#8221;</p>

<p>I like her talking style. I like her accent. Is there anything about her I don&#8217;t like?</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I am taking you to the treat&#8221;</p>

<p>A &#8216;wtf&#8217; look consumed her face. She looks cuter than ever. When has she ever looked not-cute?</p>

<p>Before she could do or say anything, I reach for the remote in my pocket and activate the holodeck.</p>

<p>Within a second, we are at a beach. I can see a bunch of whales diving around at a short distance. Nobody was within eyesight. The sun was just about to set, and the waves reached just a few feet from our feet.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where the hell are we?&#8221; She is confused and anxious. But not afraid. When has she ever been afraid of anything? Afterall, I fell for her &#8211; she can not possibly be afraid of anything.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is Southern California, about 50,000 years before we were born&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Riiiiight. Who are you, a Q? You can&#8217;t transport people back in time!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ofcourse I&#8217;m not a Q, dumbo. I can&#8217;t transport people back in time. I just recreated the beach in that old building. We never left that old building &#8211; this is that old building&#8221;</p>

<p>Within a few sentences I explain to her how a holodeck can create any place we can imagine, and how I used it to make sure that the treat is, indeed, The Treat of a Lifetime.</p>

<p>She had a hard time believing it. With the gentle wind against her beautiful face blowing her hair up in a really, really cute way, even I have trouble believing that this was not a real beach.</p>

<p>We start walking. Nobody speaks. The only sounds are the waves crashing and the distant whales.</p>

<p>I can&#8217;t bear it anymore. I have to tell her, and now.</p>

<p>&#8220;Remember the first day we met? At the Milan Cultural Festival?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure I do! You were making a big fuss about not getting the top place in photography&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Remember what you said that day?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Huh?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You said you would be the happiest person on earth if you found a mermaid who could gift you a gold fish&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Huh? WTF are you memorizing these for?&#8221; Another slight arch of her forehead.</p>

<p>I try to keep myself composed. &#8220;Well, look there&#8221;</p>

<p>I point at the sea.</p>

<p>A mermaid crawls on to the sand. She has a bowl with a golden fish in it.</p>

<p>&#8220;OMG What the hell did you do that for?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I did it because I want you to be the happiest person in the world. Because I love you. I love you&#8221;</p>

<p>A tear rolls out of my eye. I had just said what I had been hoping to say since I first met her 3 years ago.</p>

<p>Things seem to happen in slow motion. The breeze made her hair look damn cute. The setting sun made her beautiful face seem like a spectacular miracle. These few moments, from the time I closed my mouth and she opened hers, seems like an eternity. An eternity I could live with.</p>

<p>A tear rolled out of her eye too. It sparkles like the diamond it was.</p>

<p>&#8220;All these years, I was waiting for you to say it first&#8221;</p>

<p>My heart skips a beat. She has said yes. She is my girl. Finally, someone who loves me as much as I love them!</p>

<p>Three hours later, the holodeck is powered down and she returns home.</p>

<p>I get beamed back to Voyager. Duty awaits.</p>
