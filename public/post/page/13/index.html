  <p>You increase the time from 1.5 hours to 3 hours and give them another chance, of course!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Keeping in mind the welfare of children and the need for teachers to fill vacancies, the government directed TRB to conduct re-examination for candidates who failed to obtain 60 per cent marks.</p>

<p>The government has directed TRB to increase the duration of the test time from one-and-a-half hours to three hours with additional 30 minutes for blind candidates.</p>

<p>(from <a href="http://www.deccanchronicle.com/channels/nation/south/tamil-nadu-teachers-flunk-eligibility-test-348">the Deccan Chronicle</a>)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What wonderful concern for the future of our country/humanity. I also wonder if there is such a test for College Lecturers, and how the pass percentage for that would be.</p>

<p><strong>Update: </strong>Teachers now protesting against &#8216;difficulty&#8217; of test, <a href="http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2012-07-21/news/32776209_1_grace-marks-tet-teachers-eligibility-test">asking for &#8220;Grace Marks&#8221;</a>. Oh well.</p>

  <p>I&#8217;ve gotten rid of my Vim repo from GitHub, and switched to using <a href="https://github.com/gmarik/vundle">Vundle</a> + DropBox to keep my vim environment safely backed up.</p>

<p>You can find my <a href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/8768784/vimrc">.vimrc</a> file here. With just this and Vundle setup, I find it much easier to port my settings elsewhere instead of using git.</p>

<p>Hat tip to <a href="http://www.arunmozhi.in/">tecoholic</a> for pushing me to switch to Vundle :)</p>

<p>I will go back to college next year and finish. I understand that it will not be easy and that many people would consider it a pointless waste of time. That&#8217;s OK.</p>

  <p>When you&#8217;re proxying requests via nginx, you might assume after reading [the documentation][1] that every header is forwarded, except for the Host and Connection headers.</p>

<p>You&#8217;d also be wrong.</p>

<p>nginx <strong>drops</strong> all headers with an underscore in them.</p>

<p>This is a configurable settings. You can turn it on with a simple</p>

<pre>underscores_in_headers on</pre>

<p>I&#8217;m still baffled as to *why* this is <a href="http://wiki.nginx.org/HttpCoreModule#underscores_in_headers">a configuration parameter</a>. And why it is turned off by default. And why there is no mention of it in the proxy docs.</p>

<p>Thanks to <code>kolbyjack</code> on <code>#nginx</code> for helping me figure this out.</p>

  <p>Note: These are almost a decade old. Reproduced as close to memory as possible</p>

<p>My first memories of programming aren&#8217;t actually C. They were GW-BASIC, and later on, LOGO. I don&#8217;t remember any of my BASIC &#8211; but I do remember the look on my computer science teacher&#8217;s face in 5th grade when I managed to draw a flower with LOGO when everyone else was doing rectangles and lines. I vividly remember it &#8211; you draw an arc for a certain length, then stop, draw another arc in the reverse direction for the same length &#8211; and you have a petal. Then you just offset your next arc by a few degrees, repeat the previous thing, and you have another petal. Do this a few times such that <code>offset-degreese * count = 360</code> and you have a flower. That I could just modify the variables <code>length</code> and <code>offset-degree</code> to draw flowers as big, and with as many petals as you want &#8211; it blew my mind. This was in 5th grade &#8211; and I immediately started pestering my parents to put me in a programming language class outside (I had already gone to classes for _cough_MS Office<em>cough</em> and DOS back then). And the SSI nearby happened to be teaching a reasonably cheap <code>Unix/C/C++</code> class.</p>

<p>The first thing I remember still is someone telling me &#8220;you don&#8217;t need to type out clearscreen(); &#8211; clrscr() would do&#8221;. This was TurboC, and to me, at that point of time, a &#8216;good program&#8217; was one that had a <code>getch()</code> call at the end and a <code>clrscr()</code> in the beginning :)</p>

<p>The <code>Unix/C/C++</code> course &#8211; I don&#8217;t remember any Unix in it. And the C++ was disinteresting to me, because I saw no point in inheriting mammal from animal or car from vehicle. So I went about writing &#8216;C++&#8217;, which was basically C but with <code>cout</code> and <code>cin</code> instead of <code>printf()</code> and <code>scanf()</code> (I wouldn&#8217;t understand classes and how/why they were useful until I read <em>Hardcore Visual Basic 5</em> and saw the ways classes are useful and how much it sucks that VB doesn&#8217;t have them).</p>

<p>I had written a program called <code>DOSTutor</code> then (end of 5th grade, I guess?). It had screens and screens of text that &#8216;taught&#8217; you DOS commands, and then ones that made you type them in and &#8216;checked&#8217; it. Initially I had written it as a long series of <code>printf()</code> and <code>scanf()</code> statements. Suddenly some bulb went on and I realized I could cut my program size by about 90% if I separated code and data, and put the data (screen text and responses) into arrays. The feeling you get when you can reduce code drastically with no reduction in functionality (+ easier to make &#8216;fixes&#8217;) is quite incredible :)</p>

<p>But nobody ever used that program, so I wouldn&#8217;t consider that my first &#8216;program&#8217;. I spent the next year or so messing around with random <code>sound()</code> and <code>nosound()</code> calls producing &#8216;music&#8217; (including a few times when my code hit the <code>sound()</code> call, but crashed before the <code>nosound()</code> call &#8211; thus making the PC Speaker whine constantly, without any apparent way to turn it off. I used to just reset the computer then &#8211; until I learnt what exactly a <code>DOS System Call</code> meant. Then I wrote another small program that just called <code>nosound()</code>). I also remember messing around with BGI Graphics, mostly taking the example programs for <code>graphics.h</code> and modifying them to make somewhat-pretty figures.</p>

<p>My first &#8216;real&#8217; program was an implementation of a variant of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forms_of_cricket#Book_Cricket">Book Cricket</a>. It even had a stored High Scores file. It was my stint at a &#8216;programming center&#8217; (SSI, for those who remember), and I kept it in a Network Drive that I accessed using &#8216;Map Network Drive&#8217;. The amount of fun that was had when I discovered <code>rand()</code> was quite something. It even beeped when you got out!</p>

<p>I lost it all in a server crash. Just do &#8216;Map Network Drive&#8217; once and it was no longer there. I think I came home and cried :(</p>

<p>What was <em>your</em> first program?</p>

  <p>Back in Chennai</p>

<ol>
<li>Moving yuvi.in to my <a href="http://prgmr.com">prgmr</a> server. I want wordpress for my blog, but I don&#8217;t want to run MySQL. Solution? Keep blog where it is (with the awesome <a href="http://webfaction.com">webfaction</a> people!) and use <a href="http://nginx.org">nginx</a> to proxy requests to blog/. Seems to work, so yay!</li>
<li>Rewrote tawp.in to use python/flask/memcached. Available on github. Replaced older node.js version</li>
<li>Reading through _The Art of Unix Programming_ on kindle. Amazing book so far.</li>
<li>Fixed a few more bugs on Wikipedia App. I think I&#8217;ll keep &#8216;official&#8217; Wiki related stuff off this, unless it&#8217;s big?</li>
<li>Partied along new year&#8217;s. Yay. Not particularly &#8216;dev&#8217;, but still :)</li>

  <p>Worked the day first from Domlur bus terminus, and then from Exotel&#8217;s office (with @vijaysw).</p>

<ul>
<li>Incorporated search results (rather than just suggestions) into the Wikipedia app. Was a slight bitch to get right, but after that have made a bunch of variants that the others are testing out to see which one feels good (Suggestion if exists, else search, or search alone). Took up most of my time.</li>
<li>We put out a dud as RC3 for the Wikipedia app. A missing defaults statement. Lesson learnt: Test the entire process (uninstall -&gt; install -&gt; run -&gt; test) before passing off RCs</li>
<li>HyperJuice battery has arrived. Commence working out of random public places.</li>

<li>livetrains work. Trying to move (minimal) build system to waf. Somewhat complicated, not as fluid as I&#8217;d like. Go to rake. Feel weird about starting from scratch, come back to waf. Not get anything done Another rake diversion. Final Makefile editing desperation. I give up &#8211; I need to spend atleast a day to get back on proper build tools. That day is not today.

<ol>
<li>Added feature to change font size to wikipedia app. That took almost a couple of days and ended up being less than 20 lines of code. First was trying to enable pinch and zoom, but only for an iframe &#8211; proved impossible. And then a long time of headwalling about how I&#8217;m not able to manipulate the DOM inside the iframe (despite code in other places being able to do it just fine (no crossdomain issues here)), I had given up and moved elsewhere. Finally brion suggested I try inserting a <link> into <head>, which actually did work. So much for the browser being sane</li>
<li>&#8216;Refined&#8217; the search behavior of the wikipedia app a bit more. Also got bit by a difference between zepto (that we use) and jQuery (whose docs I have to read, since zepto by itself seems to have no docs). Had to read through the code to fix it, and managed to.</li>
<li>Closed a *lot* of bugs. BOY THAT FEELS GREAT!</li>

<li>Added UI for AssessmentLog [SelectionSifter]

<ol>
<li>Removed lots of dead code in SelectionSifter.</li>
<li>Went to Bangalore Wikipedia Meetup. Was nice meeting people I knew online face to face. Talked about yenWikipedia, and learnt a lot about how article selection for offline wikipedia is done.</li>
<li>Shot myself in the foot multiple times (over use of empty(), incomplete commit summaries and a tab/spaces issue). I&#8217;m rusty and it is showing. Shouldn&#8217;t be a problem anymore, though &#8211; because of you-know-what.</li>
<li>Built myself a local copy of mediawiki docs. No more annoying huge-images.</li>
<li>Got myself the solarized theme. And increased font size to normal levels (13pt). My eyes thank me.</li>
<li>Fixed timestamp related bugs in SelectionSifter.</li>

<ol>
<li>Added proper i18n for SelectionSifter.</li>
<li>Redid FilterRatings page completely.</li>
<li>Went through PhoneGap documentation, checked out state of its Photo handling API. Looks good.</li>
<li>Checked out <a href="https://github.com/Tpt/Wikipedia">patch</a> to official Wikipedia app that adds upload functionality. Needs lot more polish.</li>
