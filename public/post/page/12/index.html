  <p>I left Chennai on the 3rd of November. I (will be) leaving Delhi on the 4th of December. That&#8217;s a 31 day trip. It taught me to be optimistic. It taught me in very real terms that the world is a large place, and so is life.</p>

<p>A few highlights:</p>

<ul>
<li>Building an app from nothing to workable state in a few days</li>
<li>An actual first class train ride in India</li>
<li>Running into a bunch of random french people who ended up becoming travel buddies</li>
<li>Feeling small, and very temporary being in the ruins of Hampi. Here was a civilization that used to be great, reduced to rubble visited by 2-3 tourists a year. Our Data centers and Washington Monuments will be similar in a few hundred / thousand years. &#8220;The one thing a man can not truly have, is perspective&#8221; &#8211; DA.</li>
<li>The best lassi money can buy</li>
<li>First train ticket that was confirmed after being waitlisted</li>
<li>RAVE!</li>
<li>The scenery at the Goa Beaches</li>
<li>Learning to float in the ocean. ZOMG THIS IS AWESOME!</li>
<li>Pulling a passed out guy out of the ocean, and seeing how other locals react to that.</li>
<li>Watching Rob Moen try to negotiate with the local hawkers</li>
<li>Stopping at a Pharmacy every time we get into an Auto with Rob Moen</li>
<li>Being annoyed at Jon Robson&#8217;s eternal optimism,  and then eventually coming to accept that it is a good thing</li>
<li>Feeling incredibly unsafe in Aurangabad 2 days after Bal Thackaray&#8217;s death, harassed by a bunch of auto men.</li>
<li>Being told flat out that I&#8217;m not Indian, and having to pull out ID to prove otherwise</li>
<li>Being stranded in Aurangabad, with a bus journey out costing about 50 hours</li>
<li>An airport (Aurangabad) smelling of pure unadultered human shit.</li>
<li>Good things happening</li>
<li>Horrible horrible experience in Agra &#8211; Taj Mahal surrounded by lots and lots of slums with open sewers. Entire place being pimped out for money. The &#8216;two India&#8217;s in sharp contrast again</li>
<li>A 9 year old girl selling pens at traffic signals, speaking to me in a language I could not understand about things that do not need a spoken language to be understood</li>
<li>Surprised to find myself a grown up in Delhi</li>
</ul>

  <p>
    I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;m missing out a few things (intentionally or unintentionally) &#8211; and each of those things would merit a blog post of their own too. Maybe I&#8217;ll write them sometime. Maybe I&#8217;ll write about my (amazing) last year out too.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Thanks to @rakugojon, @riddems and @flyingclimber for making this awesome.

  <p>I am not a fan of red eye flights. Nobody is</p>

<p>I have one tomorrow. Which brings up the question &#8211; do I stay up, or go to sleep and risk not waking up in time?</p>

<p>I am going to stay up. Let&#8217;s see how that goes :-)</p>

  <p>There has been no power here since yesterday night.</p>

<p>I have a million other reasons to not like Chennai. And scarce few reasons to like it.</p>

<p>I need to get out of here. As soon as I can.</p>

  <p>SumaStorm was my desktop computer. She died a slow, silent and agonizing death over the past few months, which came to light only today. Due to my neglect, she is dead today.</p>

<p>I built SumStorm with my own hands, bought with my own money (thanks to several amazing people on the web) when I was 16 or so. It felt amazing when I first booted it up. It felt amazing when I maxed out all its cores running distcc with my netbook. It felt amazing that I could run Photoshop in a Win7 VM on Ubuntu and not feel a stutter.</p>

<p>It was an amazing machine.</p>

<p>I felt horrible when I realized the extent of the damage the rats had done. This must be how kid feel when the pet dog they grew up with dies. When run over by a tank. Which the kid was driving.</p>

<p>I did not know I could be this attached to a machine. It turned out to be a very emotional few hours.</p>

<p>RIP SumaStorm. I&#8217;m sorry.</p>

  <p>I&#8217;m blogging from (one of the many) browsers on this Raspberry Pi. Testing setting it up to do slideshows during <a href="http://jsfoo.in">JSFoo 2012</a>.</p>

<p>THIS IS SO COOL!</p>

<p>I am now editing this blog post from my new Nexus 7.</p>

<p>THIS IS SO COOL!</p>

<p>I am a few years behind the curve on this. Last year was spent slogging my ass out at a wonderful startup and travelling to a lot of places meeting and working with some wonderful people. Left very little time for staying on the bleeding edge.</p>

<p>Changing that fast &#8211; trying to produce useful stuff while also staying close to the bleeding edge. Fun times ahead :-)</p>

  <p>Earlier this month I spent a couple of days as a &#8216;guest&#8217; at Infosys Mahindra City (district finals for <a href="http://campusconnect.infosys.com/Aspirations/">Aspirations 2020</a> &#8211; a TopCoder style programming competition). Interesting experience.</p>

<p>No laptops allowed. No storage devices either. Cameras are okay, but &#8220;<em>please don&#8217;t take pictures&#8221;</em>. Phones are okay too. The usual complimentary grope as you enter. Random security guards ask &#8220;<em>Where is your ID card?&#8221;</em> at random times. Buses bringing in hordes of people. Couples being couply in food courts. Reasonably good food. Formal clothes, without regard to the weather.  Everyone smiles when talking (unless they&#8217;re security guards). Respectful deference to hierarchical authority (with a big smile &amp; explicit announcements of gratefulness). Unlocked cycles to travel around the campus.</p>

<p>A vague sense of order, but no sense of purpose.</p>

<p>This is what people are trying to (and mostly succeeding) in making Engineering &#8216;education&#8217; resemble. If you&#8217;ve made peace with how engineering colleges are, you&#8217;ll feel completely at home at Infosys. Accident?</p>

<p>A screenshot from the etherpad used for last week&#8217;s WMF Mobile Team retrospective meeting. I could (and should!) fill in several volumes about how awesome working for (and with) the WMF Mobile team is, but that screenshot is a start in explaining the general fun and silliness of the place :)</p>

  <p>You increase the time from 1.5 hours to 3 hours and give them another chance, of course!</p>

<p>Keeping in mind the welfare of children and the need for teachers to fill vacancies, the government directed TRB to conduct re-examination for candidates who failed to obtain 60 per cent marks.</p>

<p>The government has directed TRB to increase the duration of the test time from one-and-a-half hours to three hours with additional 30 minutes for blind candidates.</p>

<p>What wonderful concern for the future of our country/humanity. I also wonder if there is such a test for College Lecturers, and how the pass percentage for that would be.</p>

<p><strong>Update: </strong>Teachers now protesting against &#8216;difficulty&#8217; of test, <a href="http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2012-07-21/news/32776209_1_grace-marks-tet-teachers-eligibility-test">asking for &#8220;Grace Marks&#8221;</a>. Oh well.</p>
