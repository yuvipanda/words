  <p>I am not a fan of red eye flights. Nobody is</p>

<p>I have one tomorrow. Which brings up the question &#8211; do I stay up, or go to sleep and risk not waking up in time?</p>

<p>I am going to stay up. Let&#8217;s see how that goes :-)</p>

  <p>There has been no power here since yesterday night.</p>

<p>I have a million other reasons to not like Chennai. And scarce few reasons to like it.</p>

<p>I need to get out of here. As soon as I can.</p>

  <p>SumaStorm was my desktop computer. She died a slow, silent and agonizing death over the past few months, which came to light only today. Due to my neglect, she is dead today.</p>

<p>I built SumStorm with my own hands, bought with my own money (thanks to several amazing people on the web) when I was 16 or so. It felt amazing when I first booted it up. It felt amazing when I maxed out all its cores running distcc with my netbook. It felt amazing that I could run Photoshop in a Win7 VM on Ubuntu and not feel a stutter.</p>

<p>It was an amazing machine.</p>

<p>I felt horrible when I realized the extent of the damage the rats had done. This must be how kid feel when the pet dog they grew up with dies. When run over by a tank. Which the kid was driving.</p>

<p>I did not know I could be this attached to a machine. It turned out to be a very emotional few hours.</p>

<p>RIP SumaStorm. I&#8217;m sorry.</p>

  <p>I&#8217;m blogging from (one of the many) browsers on this Raspberry Pi. Testing setting it up to do slideshows during <a href="http://jsfoo.in">JSFoo 2012</a>.</p>

<p>THIS IS SO COOL!</p>

<p>I am now editing this blog post from my new Nexus 7.</p>

<p>THIS IS SO COOL!</p>

<p>I am a few years behind the curve on this. Last year was spent slogging my ass out at a wonderful startup and travelling to a lot of places meeting and working with some wonderful people. Left very little time for staying on the bleeding edge.</p>

<p>Changing that fast &#8211; trying to produce useful stuff while also staying close to the bleeding edge. Fun times ahead :-)</p>

  <p>Earlier this month I spent a couple of days as a &#8216;guest&#8217; at Infosys Mahindra City (district finals for <a href="http://campusconnect.infosys.com/Aspirations/">Aspirations 2020</a> &#8211; a TopCoder style programming competition). Interesting experience.</p>

<p>No laptops allowed. No storage devices either. Cameras are okay, but &#8220;<em>please don&#8217;t take pictures&#8221;</em>. Phones are okay too. The usual complimentary grope as you enter. Random security guards ask &#8220;<em>Where is your ID card?&#8221;</em> at random times. Buses bringing in hordes of people. Couples being couply in food courts. Reasonably good food. Formal clothes, without regard to the weather.  Everyone smiles when talking (unless they&#8217;re security guards). Respectful deference to hierarchical authority (with a big smile &amp; explicit announcements of gratefulness). Unlocked cycles to travel around the campus.</p>

<p>A vague sense of order, but no sense of purpose.</p>

<p>This is what people are trying to (and mostly succeeding) in making Engineering &#8216;education&#8217; resemble. If you&#8217;ve made peace with how engineering colleges are, you&#8217;ll feel completely at home at Infosys. Accident?</p>

<p>A screenshot from the etherpad used for last week&#8217;s WMF Mobile Team retrospective meeting. I could (and should!) fill in several volumes about how awesome working for (and with) the WMF Mobile team is, but that screenshot is a start in explaining the general fun and silliness of the place :)</p>

  <p>You increase the time from 1.5 hours to 3 hours and give them another chance, of course!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Keeping in mind the welfare of children and the need for teachers to fill vacancies, the government directed TRB to conduct re-examination for candidates who failed to obtain 60 per cent marks.</p>

<p>The government has directed TRB to increase the duration of the test time from one-and-a-half hours to three hours with additional 30 minutes for blind candidates.</p>

<p>(from <a href="http://www.deccanchronicle.com/channels/nation/south/tamil-nadu-teachers-flunk-eligibility-test-348">the Deccan Chronicle</a>)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What wonderful concern for the future of our country/humanity. I also wonder if there is such a test for College Lecturers, and how the pass percentage for that would be.</p>

<p><strong>Update: </strong>Teachers now protesting against &#8216;difficulty&#8217; of test, <a href="http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2012-07-21/news/32776209_1_grace-marks-tet-teachers-eligibility-test">asking for &#8220;Grace Marks&#8221;</a>. Oh well.</p>

  <p>I&#8217;ve gotten rid of my Vim repo from GitHub, and switched to using <a href="https://github.com/gmarik/vundle">Vundle</a> + DropBox to keep my vim environment safely backed up.</p>

<p>You can find my <a href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/8768784/vimrc">.vimrc</a> file here. With just this and Vundle setup, I find it much easier to port my settings elsewhere instead of using git.</p>

<p>Hat tip to <a href="http://www.arunmozhi.in/">tecoholic</a> for pushing me to switch to Vundle :)</p>

  <p>I&#8217;m just on a one year break from college doing Interesting Things and growing up. Going great on both counts.</p>

<p>I will go back to college next year and finish. I understand that it will not be easy and that many people would consider it a pointless waste of time. That&#8217;s OK.</p>
