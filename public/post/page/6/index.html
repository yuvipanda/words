  <p>This is a best effort translation of the song &#8216;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wK7shf-5soU">Clubbule Mabbule</a>&#8216; (Drunk in a Club) from Tamil to English.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><pre>(Come on, I smoke, I drink, I&rsquo;m in a live in relationship)
Fuck, get lost. This is modern culture, eh?
If you call this westernization modern culture,
then this song is dedicated right for you.
Hip hop tamizha, your Aaadheeee.</p>

<p>Women roaming around drunk in clubs
What the fuck is happening in Tamil Nadu
I salute you all
All your honor is flying away</p>

<p>Hi girls, first you say &lsquo;how are you?&rsquo;
After knowing me for 10 months you say
&lsquo;Who are you?&rsquo;
Just three words &lsquo;I love you&rsquo;
Don&rsquo;t you even know the meaning of that?</p>

<p>Hey Sheena, Leena, Meena, Veena,
Don&rsquo;t show off as knowing only little bits
of tamil with a foreign accent,
If you leave Tamil Nadu and go out,
does not mean you have to forget your mother tongue Tamil</p>

<p>Rohini, Yohini, Yamini, Kamini,
Think they are hot but are actually funny,
Don&rsquo;t blame men pointlessly,
(He is looking at me only!) Why do you do this?</p>

<p>Women roaming around drunk in clubs
What the fuck is happening in Tamil Nadu
I salute you all
All your honor is flying away</p>

<p>Women roaming around drunk in clubs
What the fuck is happening in Tamil Nadu
I salute you all
All your honor is flying away</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not blaming all women,
The deity who gave birth to me is also a woman.
All the guys come to my side,
or these girls will spoil you as well</p>

<p>Of 100, 50 are like these,
Roaming around clubs drinking and smoking,
From the time when women cooked nice food,
OH MY GOD NOW THEY ARE SMOOKING GANJA WHAT A SHAME</p>

<p>Women roaming around drunk in clubs
What the fuck is happening in Tamil Nadu
I salute you all
All your honor is flying away</p>

<p>Women roaming around drunk in clubs
What the fuck is happening in Tamil Nadu
I salute you all
All your honor is flying away</p>

<p>Pretty woman, with pretty eyes
BUT SHE HAS ONE BOTTLE OF RUM!</p>

<p>Pretty woman, with pretty eyes,
BUT WITH RUM SHE HAS HALF A PACK OF CIGARETTES</p>

<p>Pretty fairy, I don&rsquo;t need you,
You are dancing heavily drunk.</p>

<p>Gone are the times when women wore jewellery,
Now they keep smoking everywhere.
Instead of wearing sarees,
THEY ARE WEARING HANDKERCHEIFS!</p>

<p>Women roaming around drunk in clubs

  <p>In <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welcome_to_the_Machine">Welcome to the Machine</a> there is a line that goes &#8220;provided with toys and scouting for boys&#8221;. I had initially assumed that it was referring to a young guy who is gay and is &#8216;scouting for boys&#8217;.</p>

<p>And then a few days later I realized that it is talking about &#8216;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scouting_for_Boys">the book</a>&#8216;. That is now doubly funny because of the Boy Scouts&#8217; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boy_Scouts_of_America_membership_controversies#Position_on_homosexuality">attitude towards gays</a></p>

  <p>Another nice, one off Discworld book. Nice bits about how Gods are created by us, and need us more than the other way around. The philosophers are incredibly funny wherever they turn up too. The Desert after you Die bit was&#8230; beautiful &#8211; Judgement happens, but by yourself. Fun digs at governments and organized religion throughout made it rather enjoyable :)</p>

  <p>Finished that yesterday. Fun digs at war, and fun digs at people (literally) stuck in a paste despite being in the present. The bit with the Greek philosophers was also nice. No memorable recurring characters, however.</p>

  <p><a href="http://git-scm.com/book/en/">Pro Git</a> is a nice book I recommend to newbies &#8211; yet I hadn&#8217;t fully read it once. I decided to do so, and I think it was reasonably useful. Most of the stuff in here I already knew, and the treatment of the stuff I did not (Git Internals, mostly) wasn&#8217;t deep enough to be useful. Nevertheless, reinforced some useful concepts in my head and probably gave me enough strong foundations for when I decide to dive into the actual internals of git more (probably by reading the source code?). Also looked very newbie friendly, so I&#8217;ll continue recommending this to people who want to learn about Git.</p>

  <p>I&#8217;ve been reading a lot over the last few months (<a href="http://yuvi.in/blog/discworld-series-progress/">Discworld</a> + Foundation gives me about 24 books in the last 3 months), and figured I&#8217;d extend that for the next year with a little more underlying planning. So <a href="https://www.facebook.com/yuvipanda/posts/10151752346096191">along</a> with Bala, Arun &amp; Surya, I&#8217;ll try to read a hundred books this year, and also do a blog post each about them.</p>

<p><a href="http://wiki.lspace.org/mediawiki/index.php/Book:Hogfather">Hogfather</a> is the 21st book in the Discworld series I&#8217;ve read. Rather wonderful commentary on rampant consumerization of&#8230; everything, incredibly well placed (and funny!) <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELIZA">ELIZA</a> references and an undercurrent of &#8216;importance of belief&#8217;. The God of Hangovers was a nice touch.</p>

  <p>&#8220;Write once, attempt to debug everywhere&#8221; is probably way more accurate than &#8220;Write once, run anywhere&#8221; &#8211; at least for GUI apps. There&#8217;s something rather special about ideas that are theoretically amazingly wonderful yet end up being a major pain in the butt when you try to put them in practice, isn&#8217;t it?</p>

<p>The older <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.wikipedia">Wikipedia App</a> happened to be in <a href="http://phonegap.com/">PhoneGap</a>, and I consider it one of my biggest blunders to not have torn it down on day 0 and rewritten it in something saner. I once started writing a blog post for the <a href="https://blog.wikimedia.org">Wikimedia Blog</a> about why we switched from PhoneGap to native apps, but it was killed for having too much profanity in it :) Someday, perhaps.</p>
