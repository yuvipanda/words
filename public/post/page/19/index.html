  <p>Late report. But I did get quite a bit done!</p>

<p>Last week&#8230;</p>

<ol>
<li>Video Effects file format reader</li>
<li>Live Preview of Effects! (YAY!)</li>
<li>Effect files added</li>
</ol>

<p>Live Preview took most of my time. We bought down CPU usage from ~90% to a more manageable ~50%. Cleaned up code a bit (still needs more cleanup). It is rather very &#8216;demoable&#8217;, provided you gloss over the slowdowns.</p>

<p>Coming up next week would be&#8230;</p>

<ol>
<li>Even less CPU Usage! We&#8217;re now even with current Cheese (which does not give you live previews). I want to bring this down even more.</li>
<li>Reduced latency for switching operations. Moving between effects/screens now has more than a second of latency. I should reduce this to much lesser than a second.</li>
<li>Code cleanup. Some of the C code is a mess &#8211; needs to be cleaned up much.</li>
<li>Error fixing. You can now crash it by looking at it at a 58 degree angle, during new moon days. Bugs like these will be fixed.</li>
</ol>

<p>Cya in a week, with a very-usable Cheese! I&#8217;ll post a screencast as soon as I&#8217;ve made Cheese a bit more sexy :)</p>

  <p>Fourth week of the Summer of Code was over a few days back, and this report is overdue :( I&#8217;ve not been able to code as much as I wanted to this week &#8211; due to various non-technical issues. Will compensate in the next week.</p>

<p>Last week&#8230;</p>

<ol>
<li>Countdown Animations (Thanks to _ke for cleanup!)</li>
<li>GConf Cleanup</li>
</ol>

<p>Yes, that was it.</p>

<p>Totally failed to meet last week&#8217;s goals. Sigh.</p>

<p>By next week, I hope to have accomplished&#8230;</p>

<ol>
<li>Video Effects file format reader</li>
<li>Basic Effects application to the currently playing pipeline.</li>
<li>Mockups on best weay to present effects UI to user</li>
</ol>

<p>Here is to hoping the coming week turns out better than last one :)</p>

  <p>Third week of the Summer of Code is over! And during this week&#8230;.</p>

<ol>
<li>Successfully wrapped up the core cheese functionality (<code>libcheese</code>) with a vala wrapper</li>
<li>Made Photo Mode work</li>
<li>Made Video Mode work</li>
<li>Made Burst Mode work</li>
<li>Made cheese single instance using <code>libunique</code></li>
<li>Started work on cleaning up GConf code.</li>
</ol>

<p>In <a href="http://yuvi.in/blog/cheese-gsoc-report-week-2.html">last week&#8217;s report</a>, I mentioned that I didn&#8217;t quite like my pace of work. It is still the same (approx. 3 hours a day on average, excluding overhead) &#8211; but I&#8217;ve come to accept that it is okay. No more bitching about it, as long as I&#8217;m meeting my goals.</p>

<p>Last week&#8217;s predictions were to complete libcheese wrapping, photo mode, video mode and burst mode. Set goals accomplished with ample time to spare &#8211; time that was spent trying to get countdown animations to work (still haven&#8217;t managed), and make cheese single instance. I under-estimated last week &#8211; should improve accuracy.</p>

<p>By next week, I hope to have accomplished&#8230;</p>

<ol>
<li>Fully functional preferences dialog box</li>
<li>Countdown animations</li>
<li>Full GConf integration (i.e. remember all your preferences)</li>
<li>Full blown keybindings (Basically <code>&lt;Esc&gt;</code> to cancel, since the others are already implemented)</li>
<li>Trash/Delete implementation</li>
</ol>

<p>It would have everything Cheese 2.30.1 has, except for Effects.</p>

<p>And what did I learn this week?</p>

<ol>
<li>RTFM. Again. And again. THEN ask on IRC.</li>
<li>How to use gdb. I&#8217;ve only cursorily used it before &#8211; but digging into it deeper now (thank you, segfault!)</li>
</ol>

  <p>Second week of the (rather hot and sweaty) Summer of Code is over! And during this week&#8230;.</p>

<ol>
<li>Replicated most of the UI of Cheese</li>
<li>Learnt how to make C and Vala code co-exist (Thanks folks at #vala!)</li>
<li>Made the thumbnail widget work, in both modes/orientations</li>
<li>Implemented fullscreen mode, with autohiding of the action buttons</li>
<li>Started modifying parts of libcheese to support clutter for video output</li>
</ol>

<p>In <a href="http://yuvi.in/blog/cheese-gsoc-report-week-1.html">last week&#8217;s report</a>, I mentioned that I didn&#8217;t quite like my pace of work. I <em>still</em> don&#8217;t like it &#8211; <a href="http://projecthamster.wordpress.com/">Hamster</a> reports I&#8217;ve spent 15.2 hours since Monday on Cheese, which is just about 3 hours a day! Totally unacceptable, and I&#8217;d like to increase that number considerably.</p>

<p>Last week&#8217;s predictions were for libcheese integration, UI replication and Thumbnail view implementation. I&#8217;ve finished the last two, and have made a start on the first. Needs improvement.</p>

<p>By next week, I hope to have accomplished&#8230;</p>

<ol>
<li>Working video preview showing up!</li>
<li>Photo taking works</li>
<li>Video taking works</li>
<li>Burst mode works</li>
</ol>

<p>Basically, it would be usable. In a basic way.</p>

<p>And what did I learn this week?</p>

<ol>
<li>Don&#8217;t try to be too clever. Clear Code &gt; Lesser LoC.</li>
<li>Ask first. Verify assumptions.</li>
<li>Just because something can be rewritten, does not mean it should be :)</li>
</ol>

<p>On an unrelated note, my sleep cycle is totally messed up &#8211; I&#8217;ve been sleeping at 6 AM and waking up at 2 PM. Sunlight feels weird to me. I haven&#8217;t been able to do my biweekly bicycle rides :( I should also try to fix that before the end of next week.</p>

  <p>First week of official coding is over. What do I have to show for it?</p>

<ol>
<li>Moved code from Github to GNOME Git (Thanks fargiolas!)</li>
<li>Learnt how to use GTKBuilder, and how to autoconnect signals to vala callback functions.</li>
<li>Learnt <em>some</em> of the intricacies of Gtk+ Layouts (They still have a lot to teach me!)</li>
<li>Got a very basic version of the basic Cheese window up and running.</li>
<li>Learnt how to embed Clutter into the Gtk+ base of Cheese.</li>
</ol>

<p>So far so good. I don&#8217;t quite like the pace of my work &#8211; I should be going faster. Hopefully I won&#8217;t be feeling like this at the end of next week :)</p>

<p>By next week, I hope to have accomplished&#8230;</p>

<ol>
<li>Pixel perfect UI, replicating exactly what is in cheese right now (except for the viewport, ofcourse)</li>
<li>Vala bindings (<code>.vapi</code> files, basically) for <code>libcheese</code></li>
<li>Thumbnail View finished (either wrap and use current code, steal some some other project or write my own)</li>
<li>Basic work on modifying libcheese to support video output to a ClutterTexture</li>
</ol>

<p>GSoC is primarily about learning, so what have I learnt so far?</p>

<ol>
<li><code>git</code> is a powerful tool, provided you do not fight it (thanks fargiolas!)</li>
<li>Just because code works, doesn&#8217;t mean it is good enough! (thanks _ke!)</li>
<li>When you are stuck, STOP AND ASK FOR DIRECTIONS! (thanks fargiolas!)</li>
</ol>

  <p><strong>Note</strong>: I&#8217;m not an expert on Vala, GTK+, or anything else for that matter. If I am off base someplace, comment.</p>

<p>I spent quite a some time today trying to get GTKBuilder to automagically connect all my signals to their handlers. I tripped up at a few places, and so recording them here for posterity.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>If you are using instance methods (like most of us are), you&#8217;ve to decorate your handler function with the attribute <code>[CCode (instance_pos=-1)]</code>. This makes sure that the function is passed the <code>this</code> pointer as last argument, rather than first. You&#8217;ve to do this because <code>Builder.connect_signals</code> passes the instance as last parameter (<code>user_data</code>), and by aligning your <code>this</code> pointer with <code>user_data</code>, you make sure the correct instance is called.</p></li>

<li><p>Make sure your handler function signature matches what is expected. Ignore the <code>user_data</code> parameter of most signals &#8211; it is used internally by <code>Builder.connect_signals</code> (see above point).</p></li>

<li><p>Make sure you pass <code>--pkg gmodule-2.0</code> to your <code>valac</code>. If you&#8217;re using Autotools, this means you pass it to <code>VALAFLAGS</code>.</p></li>

<li><p>sure your C compiler is called with <code>-dynamic-export</code>. I&#8217;m told this enabled support for <code>dlopen</code> in the binary produced.</p></li>

<li><p>Mangle your names properly. <code>Cheese.MainWindow.on_quit()</code> becomes <code>cheese_main_window_on_quit</code> on C, and that is what GTKBuilder expects. If you are not sure how your function name is mangled by <code>valac</code>, checkout the generated <code>.c</code> file.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>If you do all these 5 things right and you&#8217;re still having trouble, turn up on #vala at irc.gimp.net and ask the helpful folks there :)</p>

  <p><em>I&#8217;m using a <a href="http://www.rememberthemilk.com/home/yuvipanda/13485943/">RTM List</a> to track my milestones for this <a href="http://yuvi.in/blog/gsoc-2010-the-beginning.html">my GSoC</a> this year. I&#8217;ll be making a blog post for each item ticked off that list, to share what I&#8217;ve learnt in my journey from n00b to someone whose code is good enough to be included in GNOME. This is part 1 in the series, where I tell you about autotools</em></p>

<p>My GSoC project involves, moving major parts (UI) of Cheese to a new language &#8211; <a href="http://live.gnome.org/Vala">Vala</a>. Vala is more an extremely glorious C preprocessor than a language of its own &#8211; it just translates down to GObject based C code, rather than bytecode/objectcode. The syntax is very C#ish &#8211; I was using <a href="http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/CSharpMode">csharp-mode</a> in emacs to code vala till I got bored enough to download <a href="http://live.gnome.org/Vala/Emacs">vala-mode</a>. It&#8217;s got closures &#8211; haven&#8217;t used them yet, here is to hoping they&#8217;re real closures. It has <em>tons</em> of libraries &#8211; it takes a few (minutes|hours) to write a binding for any C library, so many bindings already exist. You don&#8217;t lose speed &#8211; Vala is compiled down to C code. It also has one of Java&#8217;s suckiest features &#8211; <em>Checked Exceptions</em>. The documentation is non existent &#8211; you&#8217;ve to pretty much read through the bindings, or the original C library&#8217;s documentation to get anything done. And not many people know such a language exists (<a href="http://kausikram.net/">Kausik</a> for example &#8211; but he also didn&#8217;t know you could output pdf from latex, so I don&#8217;t think his opinion counts :D)</p>

<p>Cheese uses autotools for building. I had to tweak their script to make it build my Vala code as well. I&#8217;ve never worked with any of the autotools stuff before &#8211; I didn&#8217;t even know <code>.ac</code> stood for <code>autoconf</code> and <code>.am</code> stood for automake. No big deal &#8211; Google knows it all and will tell you for free. I JFGI and found a bunch of articles about using autotools to successfully build vala projects. After reading <a href="http://www.lrde.epita.fr/~adl/autotools.html">this monstrous (180+ slides, but ~500 pages) Autotools presentation</a> (which is actually very, <em>very</em> good, btw), I had a working build script. It built my single <code>cheese.vala</code> file that did nothing but run a loop and wait to be terminated. It had a place where I could add more <code>.vala</code> files and they should (should) be included in the build. It was hackish, but like most hacks, it worked. <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2007/03/the-works-on-my-machine-certification-program.html">On My Machine</a>&trade;.</p>

<p>Nowhere else. Turned out my script wasn&#8217;t working at all &#8211; just faking it to me. I had initially tested out <code>valac</code> (the vala compiler), which had produced a <code>.c</code> file. Since <code>make</code> was supposed to produce the same file, and it wasn&#8217;t stale (I hadn&#8217;t touched my <code>cheese.vala</code>), it just proceeded to compiling the <code>.c</code> files with <code>gcc</code>. The Vala part of the build script wasn&#8217;t being executed at all. Removing the <code>.c</code> file told me that my hackish script hadn&#8217;t worked at all.</p>

<p>After banging my head for a while to figure out <em>why</em> it wasn&#8217;t working, I finally landed up on the official autotools docs. Autotools had added <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/hello/manual/automake/Vala-Support.html">native vala support</a>. The hack I found was not necessary.</p>

<p><em>facepalm</em></p>

<p><strong>Moral of the Story</strong>: RTFM comes first, not JFGI.</p>

<p>Anyway, I rewrote the build script to be much more cleaner in a couple of minutes. And it worked.</p>

<p>Build systems are actually a lot of fun once you get the hang of it. A black screen with fast scrolling green text cryptic to everyone else but totally sensible to you is incredibly attractive, no? :)</p>

This is part 0 in the series, where I tell you what my project is all about and how <a href="http://projects.gnome.org/cheese">Cheese</a> is going to become awesomer.</em></p>

<p>So, what exactly does <a href="http://gist.github.com/356202">my proposal</a> mean for Cheese?</p>

<ol>
<li>Moving the UI to <a href="http://live.gnome.org/Vala">Vala</a> (from C)</li>
<li>Move display bits from <a href="http://www.gtk.org/">GTK+</a> to <a href="http://clutter-project.org/">clutter</a></li>
<li>Implement Live Preview to show people how applying an effect will look before applying it</li>
<li>Implement loadable effects so you aren&#8217;t stuck with just 12 preloaded effects.</li>
</ol>

<p>I&#8217;m told that the scope is kinda too big for 3 months &#8211; but I&#8217;m sure that with careful planning (hah!), around 40 hours of work a week (haha!), lots of time away from college (hahaha!) I can do this stuff :)</p>

<p>I&#8217;m keeping my code in a <a href="http://github.com/yuvipanda/cheese">github repo</a>, so watch that for code updates. And will be updating this blog at the completion of every milestone, so subscribe if you haven&#8217;t :)</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: My exams are still going on. Won&#8217;t be coding much till they end (May 19th).</p>

  <p>As part of my <a href="http://yuvi.in/blog/gsoc-2010-the-beginning.html">GSoC</a> preparations, I wrote a few patches for <a href="http://projects.gnome.org/cheese">Cheese</a>. <a href="http://git.gnome.org/browse/cheese/commit/?id=fba61486adb3fb9e0172e79ffd8beeaef079ab30">One of them</a> (a one liner to fix a crash) has made it to <a href="http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.comp.gnome.devel.announce/94">GNOME 2.30.1</a> &#8211; the other two (<a href="https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=592081">1</a> and <a href="https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=597226">2</a>) are slightly more significant and involve UI changes, and so will be integrated later.</p>

<p>Free beer to everyone who can catch me in a bar! Free Pepsi/Sprite/Egg Puff to anyone who can catch me in the College Stores ;)</p>

<p>I mentioned this in passing in my <a href="http://yuvi.in/blog/hacking-more.html">earlier post</a>, and was tweeting about it quite furiously &#8211; I&#8217;ve been selected to work on <a href="http://yuvi.in/blog/hacking-more.html">Cheese</a> for this year&#8217;s <a href="http://socghop.appspot.com/gsoc/program/list_projects/google/gsoc2010">Google Summer of Code</a> :D</p>

<p><a href="http://gist.github.com/356202">Link to my, uhm, <em>cheesy</em> proposal</a></p>

<h3 id="what-now">What Now?</h3>

<p>Getting accepted doesn&#8217;t mean shit. Actually finishing whatever I was supposed to within 3 months does mean <em>something</em> &#8211; especially since I&#8217;ve taken on quite a bit of stuff to do (Move to new language + 2 new features). I&#8217;m quite the n00b &#8211; first time I&#8217;ll be doing just <em>one</em> thing over 3 months. Will be setting up a way of monitoring progress (probably via set milestones) soon enough. Will keep this place posted :)</p>

<p>Also, say Hi to my mentor <a href="http://home.cs.tum.edu/~siegel/">daniel siegel</a>. Him and fellow cheese-dev <a href="http://blogs.gnome.org/fargiolas/">Flippio Argiolas</a>, who were extremely helpful in getting my proposal whipped into shape (It&#8217;s a gist, so you can see how it eveolved over time).</p>

<p>The Oscar acceptance style blog post will be turned in once the three months are over and the newer, improved Cheese is accepted as good enough :D</p>
