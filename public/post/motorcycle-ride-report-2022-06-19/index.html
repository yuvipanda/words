<p>Need to learn to plan when to <em>pee</em>. This is important to do! Can&rsquo;t just get off any

<p>Need to learn more about lane splitting and how and <em>when</em> to do it safely. I did it

More research needed.</p>
<p>I need to adjust my levers to see if it helps with my skin near thumb getting sore.</p>
<p>Get a different seat maybe for more comfort? My butt does hurt and is sore.</p>
<p>I definitely need to feel much more confident in curves. Taking the TC class is a good
next step.</p>
<p><strong>DO NOT BELIEVE GOOGLE MAPS TIME ESTIMATES!!</strong> I am much slower than that haha.</p>
<p>I need to work on my core strenght, back to the Gym. I think without that, long rides
are going to be painful.</p>
<p>Need to plan <em>meals</em> better too. I&rsquo;m eating &rsquo;lunch&rsquo; at like 4:30, after having only eaten
3/4 cup of oats and 1 butter croissant all day. That isn&rsquo;t enough. Partially this is because
I couldn&rsquo;t leave on time either - as usual. Still meant I left at 12 rather than 2 - but could&rsquo;ve
left at 10!</p>
<h3 id="post-trip-notes">Post trip notes</h3>
<p>This is at night. The ride back was all interstate, and quite different!</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Food</strong> makes a <em>huge</em> difference. I think I need to eat more than I think too. Just everything
was better after food. I should just always eat, and eat on time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I am getting more confident about turns at speed. I think by default I end up slowing down
for each turn from fear. That is pretty dangerous! I need to have a better understanding of
how much traction is available, and just turn. Which way to lean is also important - but
I think my current intuition (counter lean or neutral) is good enough for me. I saw some
guy shred the twisties when I was up in the berkeley hills, and he had to lean quite a
bit. Not what I&rsquo;m doing though.</p>
<p>I should <strong>take more classes</strong> and read the total control book properly. Towards the end
I was feeling pretty confident, and that was quite nice!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The way back was north, with the sun directly into my eyes for almost an hour. Was intense,
I could barely see! I had sunvisor down and transition glasses and that wasn&rsquo;t enough at
all. I was in a trance. Looking back, how did I trust myself enough to go through that?!
Would I have been able to see hazards on the road? Stopped cars? I was able to control
speed pretty well. I was a bit tired too. But I did Montarey to San Jose in one go,
and stopped - my body basically forced me to stop and rest. I don&rsquo;t entirely know how
I feel about this. I think it was mostly safe, as it was just on the interstate and I
was on the left-ish lane. I also think I could actually mostly see - what I see in
my memory now, hours after the fact, doesn&rsquo;t seem quite right - feels filtered. It really
was just an intense trance. I don&rsquo;t mind interstate riding.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I should strap my bag down and not carry it! I think that will definitely help my back
hurt a lot less. I had 2 bottles of water, laptop and ipad - I think that&rsquo;s a lot.
I should consider a smaller bag too.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A more comfortable seat would also help. My butt was pretty sore.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Physical strength is an important component of safety, and I <em>must</em> get back to the gym.
Particularly, while turning I could feel my core was not strong enough several times,
and I would like more trust in my muscle strenghts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I lane-split a little! Just for parts of CA-17S, when in otherwise almost stopped
traffic. I need to learn way more about it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I should understand trail braking better. I think my understanding of it right now
is dangerously flawed, as it contributes to me slowing down excessively in turns. Could
get rear ended.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Really need a windshield. I can hardly even look at my mirrors in the interstate, because
I can&rsquo;t bring my torso up at all.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I drifted into next lane almost in one turn I think because I wasn&rsquo;t braking and
I was tired. I was trying to &lsquo;push through&rsquo; and at some point even didn&rsquo;t want to break
in San Jose. WTF was that, compromising safety for challenge! No way.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I need to leave earlier so I can have more time at my target spaces. In fact, I should
look for nice target spaces first and then travel - flip my currnet model a little. I
don&rsquo;t think I need to just haul miles anymore. Past that stage now.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The bananas in my backpack were smushed to death and the inside of my backpack is a banana
smoothie. Would not recommend</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="todos">TODOs</h3>
<p>Concrete action items!</p>
<ol>
<li>Always eat before a ride</li>
<li>Get a better helmet. I&rsquo;ve spent months looking for the right one, time to look again :(</li>
<li>Start going through <a href="https://ridelikeachampion.com/courses-page/">Champ U</a> that I
already bought</li>
<li>Look for another intermediate mototrcycling course I can take.</li>
<li>Plan time at conclusion of journey better.</li>
<li>Get a windshield for the bike.</li>
<li>Experiment with getting luggage off my back</li>
</ol>
