      <p>In conversation with <a href="https://nirbheek.in/">Nirbheek</a> about <a href="http://words.yuvi.in/post/note-taking-part-i/">my blog post on note taking</a>, he said something like &lsquo;my system of knowledge has holes, and I lose track of stuff I learnt because of that&rsquo;. This was slightly complementary to my earlier quest - the outliner helped me in structuring how I thought and produced content. However, a bookmarking system will help me consume and <strong>retain</strong> knowledge. Both need to be integrated, but I currently had only one half of the puzzle.</p>
<p>We ended up talking about &lsquo;bookmarks&rsquo; and how he has a lot of them. I&rsquo;ve felt the need for saving stuff I read in useful ways, but never used bookmarks because I never look at them again. It would be awesome to have a system of that sort - especially if it was integrated into my notetaking and todo list solutions.</p>
<p>We talked about some current solutions - <a href="https://twitter.com/prxtl">Pratul</a>&rsquo;s meticulously tagged <a href="https://pinboard.in/">pinboard</a> account, <a href="https://ankursethi.in/">Ankur</a>&rsquo;s blog&rsquo;s <a href="https://ankursethi.in/category/links/">links category</a>. All this was too much work for me, but I couldn&rsquo;t quite articulate why. I&rsquo;ve tried both these options before and couldn&rsquo;t keep them up. Longevity was my goal here, so I kept looking.</p>
<h2 id="memex">Memex</h2>
<p>This lead us to <a href="https://github.com/WorldBrain/Memex">Memex</a>, and open source system (with a paid hosted version) that seemed to do everything we wanted. They made a particular point of <a href="https://github.com/WorldBrain/Memex#no-vc-money-no-exit-your-data--attention-stays-yours">not taking VC money</a>, which is a big draw for me.</p>
<p>Nirbheek tried it out, and found it buggy / wanting. Particularly, it only worked on half his bookmarks - the rest had rotten, or the import itself was buggy. This could be fixed with <a href="https://archive.org/">Internet Archive</a> integration, but there were a few more bugs about data loss in their <a href="https://github.com/WorldBrain/Memex/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-desc">issue tracker</a> that didn&rsquo;t give me too much confidence. It does still look amazing, and I will try it out at some point soon - unlike Nirbheek, I don&rsquo;t have a few thousand bookmarks to import.</p>
<p>However, it gave met he name <strong>Memex</strong>, with a history behind it - an article by Vannevar Bush (Claude Shannon was his student) from 1945 called <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memex">As we may think</a></strong>. This was an extremely fascinating read - I read it in the <a href="http://worrydream.com/refs/Bush%20-%20As%20We%20May%20Think%20(Life%20Magazine%209-10-1945).pdf">original layout</a>, with fascinating ads by the side (Men&rsquo;s garters, for example).</p>
<p>Here is my <a href="/papers/as-we-may-think.pdf">annotated version</a>, with the origins of the rest of this blog post at the bottom. It&rsquo;s fairly short, so I suggest you read the original. I&rsquo;m not going to rehash it, but just talk about what I think I need in my &lsquo;bookmarking&rsquo; solution.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-a-bookmark">What is a bookmark?</h2>
<p>Bookmark is a terrible word for what I want, but I can&rsquo;t think of a better one right now. Bush defines the &lsquo;memex&rsquo; as:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A memex is a device in which an individual stores all his books, records and communications, and which is mechanized so that it may be consulted with <strong>exceeding speed and flexibility</strong>. It is an <strong>enlarged intimate supplement to his memory</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(Gendered pronouns in the source left in for for faithful reproduction. I&rsquo;d like to think that if this was written today, it would use gender neutral pronouns)</p>
<p>So a &lsquo;bookmark&rsquo; is an individual thing that I come across that I might possibly ever want to remember again. I can&rsquo;t remember it all, so I want to toss it into a &lsquo;bookmarking system&rsquo; that can be searched with &lsquo;exceeding speed and flexibility&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Based on this, I figured out my current criteria for looking at &amp; trying out such systems to find one that meets my needs.</p>
<h2 id="search-first">Search first</h2>
<p>I want my interface to be a simple text box into which I can type things, and it&rsquo;ll search the entire contents of everything I&rsquo;ve &lsquo;bookmarked&rsquo;. This should be articles I&rsquo;ve read, books, tweets, videos I&rsquo;ve watched, podcasts I&rsquo;ve listened to, my notes, etc. I don&rsquo;t want to do any tagging or categorizing myself.</p>
<p>Tagging and categorizing remind me of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DMOZ">dmoz</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahoo!_Directory">Yahoo Directories</a>. Way too much work for me, and I&rsquo;ll never look at them again.</p>
<p>Bush calls <strong>selection</strong> (we would call that &lsquo;search&rsquo; today) as the primary problem , and rails against <strong>indexing</strong> (IMO we would call this tagging / categorizing) as insufficient.</p>
<p>This search needs to be <strong>extremely fast</strong>, and very relevant.</p>
<h2 id="never-forgets">Never forgets</h2>
<p>I should have access to these &lsquo;bookmarks&rsquo; all the time. This means cross-device sync (Android, iPad, Mac OS for me).</p>
<p>It also needs to actually archive all the content I throw at it. Save web pages fully. Download (and transcribe) videos / podcats. Find some way to keep books in there. No link rot, no &lsquo;shit this content is now behind a paywall&rsquo;, no &lsquo;damn, I wish I had my laptop with me&rsquo;.</p>
<h2 id="hyperlinking">Hyperlinking</h2>
<p>I should be able to connect bookmarks together. I guess this could be done with tagss, but I want something else that&rsquo;s better. Bush talks about being able to link &lsquo;bookmarks&rsquo; to each other with a blurb about the link - this is what we would call a &lsquo;hyperlink&rsquo; now.</p>
<p>My note taker has hyperlinks with other notes, but I should be able to hyperlink to content I have saved. I should also be able to link together content I&rsquo;ve saved that doesn&rsquo;t have links themselves.</p>
<p>Strong integration between this and my note taker is probably the way to go. <strong>Each piece of content should have highlights, and notes attached to them</strong>. These could contain hyperlinks easily. The highlights and notes should also be searchable.</p>
<h2 id="publishable">Publishable</h2>
<p>Bush talks about &lsquo;trailblazers&rsquo; - people who find new content, link it together in useful ways, and publish it for others.</p>
<p>This was how I used <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Reader#Sharing">Google Reader&rsquo;s Shared</a> functionality. You could publish a link with all the content you have consumed that you marked as &lsquo;shared&rsquo;, with a note as well. I would subscribe to other people&rsquo;s shared feeds, and find useful content (and blogs) to follow.</p>
<p>RIP Google Reader. It continues to make me wary of relying on any of Google&rsquo;s services.</p>
<p>Having a note taker has already drastically changed how I think and  produce content. I feel integrating this into my life will have similar effects on how I consume content. Now that I have a better idea of what I <strong>want</strong>, I&rsquo;ll spend some more time looking.</p>
