      <p>I walked into a local hardware store, with the following thought in my mind:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I need a 5mm metric hex key</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And I wandered around aimlessly as I do in stores, almost bought some double
sided tape for a different project (decided against it), and eventually made it
to the place with all the sockets, hex keys, screwdrivers, etc.</p>
<p>Words that previously meant nothing to me (Torx, SAE, metric) made <em>sense</em>. Felt
a little like the very first time I felt power learning to write code (the strongest
memory is that of changing color of a button in VB6 with one line of code). What was
noise before had meaning now.</p>
<p>I got myself a little folding metric key set with hex keys going from 1mm to 6mm - I
knew I had some new windscreen clip-ons that needed a 4mm key, and am sure I&rsquo;ll find a 6mm
somewhere.</p>
<p>I pick up something that costs 13$, and looks ok. I look at a different brand, and decide
I like that better because of the way it folds. &ldquo;Hey, this means when I try to turn it,
I&rsquo;ll get better leverage!&rdquo;. I <em>actually</em> know what that sentence means, and I choose one
brand over another <em>based on actual knowledge</em> rather than a guess. If my programming
experience is anything to go by, I&rsquo;m completely wrong in ways I won&rsquo;t even understand for
a long time.</p>
<p>But I buy it, leave the store, and try using it for intended purpose on my motorcycle -
to remove the bolts holding my bar end weights in. Earlier that week, I had stripped these
by attempting to use a friend&rsquo;s impact driver with a torx bit (it sort of fit, and I had
no mental model about what I was doing!). The head stripped, and the thread stripped, and
I took it to Performance Motorcycles in Berkeley who fixed it up for me (although the bolt
itself did break and they had to put a new one in).</p>
<p>I had since beat myself up about not knowing enough about hardware to not strip the head,
been comforted by a friend, realized that I had set weird standards for myself where somehow
I must already know all of this having never put in any <em>effort</em> to learn, and then being
delighted that &lsquo;oh wait this is just another skillset I can pick up&rsquo;. It will probably take
years, but that&rsquo;s ok!</p>
<p>Earlier that day, I had went back to the mechanic and asked him exactly what screw he had
used for the bolt. He told me it was a 5mm hex, and I should use an exact one or I will strip.</p>
<p>I extend the 5mm key, and fit it in. It seems to be a perfect fit! I try twisting left,
repeating internally to myself &ldquo;Lefty loosy&rdquo;. It doesn&rsquo;t budge, and I&rsquo;m slightly anxious.
But I trust that it is not super likely to strip at this point - I&rsquo;m not a very strong person,
and this I fully believed was the correct size. So I put more energy into it.</p>
<p>AND THE BOLT TURNS! I FEEL ELATED! AMAZING JOY! It is a bit like seeing your code run for
the first time, AND IT FEELS AWESOME!</p>
<p>So excited for this future :)</p>
