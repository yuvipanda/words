  <h2 id="gracefully-exiting-asyncio-application">Gracefully exiting asyncio application</h2>
<p>Continuing yesterday&rsquo;s work on my <a href="https://github.com/yuvipanda/simpervisor">simple supervisor library</a>,
I continued trying to propagate signals cleanly to child processes
before exiting. I remembered that it isn&rsquo;t enough to just propagate
signals - you also have to actually reap them. This meant waiting
for <code>wait</code> calls on them to return.</p>
<p>I had a task running concurrently that is waiting on these
processes. So &lsquo;all&rsquo; I had to do was make sure the application
does <em>not</em> exit until these tasks are done. This turned
out to be harder than I thought! After a bunch of reading, I
recognized that what I needed to do was make sure I wait
for all pending tasks before actually exiting the application.</p>
<p>This was more involved than I thought. It also must be done
at the application level rather than in the library - you don&rsquo;t
want libraries doing sys.exit, and definitely don&rsquo;t want them
closing event loops.</p>
<p>After a bunch of looking and playing, it <em>looks</em> like what I want is
in my application code is something like:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="color:#66d9ef">if</span> __name__ <span style="color:#f92672">==</span> <span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;__main__&#39;</span>:
    loop <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> asyncio<span style="color:#f92672">.</span>get_event_loop()
    <span style="color:#66d9ef">try</span>:
        loop<span style="color:#f92672">.</span>run_until_complete(main())
    <span style="color:#66d9ef">finally</span>:
        loop<span style="color:#f92672">.</span>run_until_complete(asyncio<span style="color:#f92672">.</span>gather(<span style="color:#f92672">*</span>asyncio<span style="color:#f92672">.</span>Task<span style="color:#f92672">.</span>all_tasks()))
        loop<span style="color:#f92672">.</span>close()
</code></pre></div><p>This waits for all tasks to complete before exiting, and seems
to make sure all child processes are reaped. However, I have a
few unresolved questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>What happens when one of the tasks is designed to run forever,
and never exit? Should we cancel all tasks? Cancel tasks after
a timeout? Cancelling tasks after a timeout seems most
appropriate.</li>
<li>If a task schedules more tasks, do those get run? Or are they
abandoned? This seems important - can tasks keep adding more
tasks in a loop?</li>
</ol>
<p>I am getting a better handle on what people mean by &lsquo;asyncio is
more complicated than needed&rsquo;. I&rsquo;m going to find places to read
up on asyncio internals - particularly how the list of pending
tasks is maintained.</p>
<p>This <a href="https://www.roguelynn.com/words/asyncio-we-did-it-wrong-pt-1/">series of blog posts</a>
and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1lJDZx6f6tY">this EuroPython talk</a>
from <a href="https://www.roguelynn.com/">Lynn Root</a> helped a lot.
So did <a href="https://github.com/saghul">Saúl Ibarra Corretgé</a> (one of the asyncio core devs)
talk on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HppNu0-ANYw">asyncio internals</a></p>
<h3 id="testing">Testing</h3>
<p>Testing code that involves asyncio, signals and processes is
hard. I attempted to do so with <code>os.fork</code>, but decided that is
super-hard mode and I&rsquo;d rather not play. Instead, I wrote Python
code verbatim that is then spawned as a subprocess, and use
stdout to communicate back to the parent process. The child process&rsquo;
code itself is <a href="https://github.com/yuvipanda/simpervisor/blob/b130203a0a497d26f438a6ab3c9511a3c3de60ab/tests/test_atexitasync.py#L13">inline</a>
in the test file, which is terrible. I am going to move it to its
own file.</p>
<p>I also added tests for multiple signal handlers. I&rsquo;ve been writing
a lot more tests in the last few months than I was before. I credit
<a href="https://github.com/betatim">Tim Head</a> for a lot of this. It definitely
gives me a lot more confidence in my code.</p>
