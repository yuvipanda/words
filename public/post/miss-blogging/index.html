  <p>This person <a href="http://tttthis.com/blog/if-i-could-bring-one-thing-back-to-the-internet-it-would-be-blogs">misses blogs a lot</a>.
So do I. I made many frients, built myself a platform, and expressed myself in ways I do not feel
like I can anymore on my various blogs. Some of them are lost to time, but some are there if you know
how to find it.</p>
<p>Part of it was where my life was - I had time, nobody physically nearby I jived with, and a
<strong>lot</strong> of angst. But now, I have too little time, and too many (hah!) wonderful people I enjoy
interacting with on a 1-1 basis, nearby or not. Plus, with the death of blogging platforms
(Medium is a publishing platform, not a blogging one), content is harder to find. As the author
points out,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The other day I searched for an hour and couldn&rsquo;t find even one. They used to be endless. You&rsquo;d just click on one you knew on Blogger and either click Blogger&rsquo;s random blog button, or go to the sidebar of the blog you knew where they always had a list of blogs they liked, sometimes four or 5, sometimes 20 other blogs. And the same with Tumbler.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technorati">Technorati</a> is dead, and there isn&rsquo;t anything like it.
Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Medium, etc are no replacements for long form text insight into
someone&rsquo;s lives. They have brought the internet experience to way more people, but I feel like
they have taken something away from me.</p>
<p>I guess this will be one of those blog posts that end with me saying &ldquo;I will try to blog more&rdquo;
and then there are no more posts for the next few years :)</p>
