      <p>I went to the protests at SFO last weekend. It was the first real set of protests I&rsquo;ve been to. I write this to attempt to capture a sliver of what I felt that day.</p>
<p>I was there for about 10h on day 1, and came home exhausted. I went back on Day 2, and this time stayed for much shorter period of time (~4h?) before heading back home.</p>
<p>To everyone who was at the protest even if it does not directly affect you yet - <em>thank you</em>!</p>
<p>To the wonderful amazing women of color who were leading the protest - <em>thank you</em>. You are an inspiration.</p>
<p>To the brass band and the troupe of drummers who showed up - <em>thank you</em>!</p>
<p>To the people I already know from other contexts who I ran into at the protest - <em>thank you</em>!</p>
<p>To those who were protesting for the first time in their lives (as I was) - <em>thank you</em>!</p>
<p>To the fucking ACLU - <em>thank you</em>! I&rsquo;ll send you all the money I can :)</p>
<p>To the people who provided infrastructure (food, water, snacks, first aid, printers, internet, etc) - <em>thank you</em>!</p>
<p>To the journalists who covered this - <em>thank you</em>.</p>
<p>I woke up that saturday feeling very depressed, angry, and helpless. By sunday night, I was only depressed and angry - but not helpless. The number and variety of people at the protests was very heartwarming, and made me feel distinctly not alone. Before going I was not sure what going to a protest accomplishes. I still do not know - but I know it gave me hope and restored my sense of agency.</p>
<p>I promise I&rsquo;ll continue doing all I can, even and especially when it is about things that do not affect me yet. I hope you do too.</p>
