 Building an app from nothing to workable state in a few days An actual first class train ride in India Running into a bunch of random french people who ended up becoming travel buddies Feeling small, and very temporary being in the ruins of Hampi." />

  <p>I left Chennai on the 3rd of November. I (will be) leaving Delhi on the 4th of December. That&#8217;s a 31 day trip. It taught me to be optimistic. It taught me in very real terms that the world is a large place, and so is life.</p>

<p>A few highlights:</p>

<ul>
<li>Building an app from nothing to workable state in a few days</li>
<li>An actual first class train ride in India</li>
<li>Running into a bunch of random french people who ended up becoming travel buddies</li>
<li>Feeling small, and very temporary being in the ruins of Hampi. Here was a civilization that used to be great, reduced to rubble visited by 2-3 tourists a year. Our Data centers and Washington Monuments will be similar in a few hundred / thousand years. &#8220;The one thing a man can not truly have, is perspective&#8221; &#8211; DA.</li>
<li>The best lassi money can buy</li>
<li>First train ticket that was confirmed after being waitlisted</li>
<li>RAVE!</li>
<li>The scenery at the Goa Beaches</li>
<li>Learning to float in the ocean. ZOMG THIS IS AWESOME!</li>
<li>Pulling a passed out guy out of the ocean, and seeing how other locals react to that.</li>
<li>Watching Rob Moen try to negotiate with the local hawkers</li>
<li>Stopping at a Pharmacy every time we get into an Auto with Rob Moen</li>
<li>Being annoyed at Jon Robson&#8217;s eternal optimism,  and then eventually coming to accept that it is a good thing</li>
<li>Feeling incredibly unsafe in Aurangabad 2 days after Bal Thackaray&#8217;s death, harassed by a bunch of auto men.</li>
<li>Being told flat out that I&#8217;m not Indian, and having to pull out ID to prove otherwise</li>
<li>Being stranded in Aurangabad, with a bus journey out costing about 50 hours</li>
<li>An airport (Aurangabad) smelling of pure unadultered human shit.</li>
<li>Good things happening</li>
<li>Horrible horrible experience in Agra &#8211; Taj Mahal surrounded by lots and lots of slums with open sewers. Entire place being pimped out for money. The &#8216;two India&#8217;s in sharp contrast again</li>
<li>A 9 year old girl selling pens at traffic signals, speaking to me in a language I could not understand about things that do not need a spoken language to be understood</li>
<li>Surprised to find myself a grown up in Delhi</li>
</ul>

  <p>
    I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;m missing out a few things (intentionally or unintentionally) &#8211; and each of those things would merit a blog post of their own too. Maybe I&#8217;ll write them sometime. Maybe I&#8217;ll write about my (amazing) last year out too.
