      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m doing a bunch of autograding work in the Jupyter ecosystem. I&amp;rsquo;ve little direct experience in this vast area, which makes building good systems for it hard. When I have explicit users with specific use cases to meet, it always becomes easier. This blog post is an attempt to:
 Explain the use cases &amp;amp; users I need to serve Describe the components I am working on  As usual, I am attempting to build these within the larger Jupyter community in ways everyone can use, rather than just the amazing folks at Berkeley.</description>
