      <description>I am not smart enough to consistently write and debug shell scripts that use any conditional or looping constructs. So as soon as I&amp;rsquo;m writing something in bash that requires use of those, I switch to python. This works fine when writing scripts, but what to do when writing GitHub Actions workflows? You can only write bash in run: stanzas in your steps, right?&#xA;Not at all! You can set the shell parameter to anything you want, and the contents of run will be passed to the shell in the form of a file.</description>
