  <p>Let&#8217;s see. I&#8217;m also going to attempt to include patch links wherever possible.</p>

<ul>
<li>Cleaned up <code>session</code> handling bugs in Quarry. They were previously not closing properly, causing SQLAlchemy exceptions now and then that&#8217;ll let queries die in a &#8216;queued&#8217; state. This should <em>hopefully</em> be fixed by <a href="https://gerrit.wikimedia.org/r/#/c/156909/">https://gerrit.wikimedia.org/r/#/c/156909/</a>.</li>
<li>Made <a href="https://graphite.wmflabs.org">https://graphite.wmflabs.org</a> somewhat more stable again for use by Wikimedia BetaLabs folks by just blacklisting all other projects from sending data to it (with a local whitelist hack + <a href="https://gerrit.wikimedia.org/r/#/c/156966/">https://gerrit.wikimedia.org/r/#/c/156966/</a>). This would let them use it, and they said they would find it massively useful. All this is a hack until <a href="https://rt.wikimedia.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=8163">https://rt.wikimedia.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=8163</a> could be resolved and I can deploy graphite on a &#8216;real&#8217; machine.</li>
<li>Minor patch to my Gerrit -&gt; IRC bot to make it strip a common prefix (&#8216;operations/&#8217;) from change messages posted to the operations channel &#8211; <a href="https://gerrit.wikimedia.org/r/#/c/156877/">https://gerrit.wikimedia.org/r/#/c/156877/</a>. Also made one that calls jenkins-bot jerkins-bot if it -1&#8217;s your patch (<a href="https://gerrit.wikimedia.org/r/#/c/156878/">https://gerrit.wikimedia.org/r/#/c/156878/</a>) but it seems to have a bug that I can&#8217;t be bothered to debug atm.</li>
</ul>

<p>Might spend some more time with Hive over the next few days &#8211; figured out an approach for using it from Python, and it should be fun to do so!</p>

  <p>Not very code heavy</p>

<ul>
<li>Couple of pull requests(<a href="https://github.com/atom/autosave/pull/22">#1</a> and <a href="https://github.com/atom/autosave/pull/21">#2</a>) for the <a href="https://github.com/atom/autosave">Atom Autosave plugin</a>. One adds a preference to not autosave by when you are explicitly closing a window / pane, and the other just sets the &#8216;enabled&#8217; preference to default. CoffeeScript isn&#8217;t too bad either! I should consider writing more plugins (I currently use Atom for CSS/JS/Puppet, should try other languages)</li>
<li>Added CSV, TSV and JSON download options to Quarry. There&#8217;s another Webinar tomorrow by the Grantmaking team, and J-Mo asked for it. Streaming TSV and CSV implemented in a neat way, will write a blog post tomorrow about it.</li>
<li>Started work on a &#8216;number of editors&#8217; per country metric for WPDMZ, needs to be finished up.</li>
</ul>

<p>I feel a bit exhausted (physically and mentally) from the intense coding over the last few weeks, might have a few chill days to recharge myself. I&#8217;m growing old! :(</p>

  <p>Wooooo!</p>

<ul>
<li>Moved <a href="https://github.com/yuvipanda/labsbooks">labsbooks</a> (described in <a href="http://yuvi.in/blog/devlog-23-aug-2014/">yesterday&#8217;s devlog</a>) to use a shared readonly IPython virtualenv maintained by me. Also installed a bunch of modules people might want to use (SciPy, NumPy, Pandas, PyTables, matplotlib). Am considering just installing IPython notebook globally via puppet and using that, since that&#8217;ll enable users to just use the system packages. However, the version of IPython notebook from Ubuntu is ancient, so that&#8217;s probably a non-starter.</li>
<li>Have a basic version of the IPython publishing process working! Any toollabs user can create a notebook by:

<ul>
<li>Creating a <code>~/notebooks</code> folder</li>
<li>Doing a <code>chmod +x ~/notebooks</code></li>
<li>Doing a <code>chmod +x ~</code></li>
<li>Putting IPython notebooks into <code>~/notebooks</code> (as <code>.ipynb</code>) files</li>
<li>Going to <code>https://tools.wmflabs.org/notebooks/&lt;user-shell-name&gt;/&lt;path-to-ipynb-file&gt;</code> Will have to do a bit more work before it can be considered &#8216;production grade&#8217; (such as user pages, a nicer theme, etc, etc) BUT YAY GOOD START. It already caches the html output in Redis and invalidates with the <code>mtime</code> of the file, so should be pretty quick.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Made the ssh tunneling process for <code>labsbooks</code> purely python, without requiring the <code>ProxyCommand</code>. This makes things simpler (and more portable!). I&#8217;ll need to work on securing this properly before I can publish it for broader use.</li>
<li>Wrote <a href="https://lists.wikimedia.org/pipermail/analytics/2014-August/002437.html">an email</a> to the analytics mailing list about making public the &#8216;edits per country&#8217; data. I hope to make this publicly available with enough granularity that not just me but others can use this for fun research as well.</li>
</ul>

<p>I&#8217;ve been using <a href="https://atom.io">Atom</a> for puppet stuff, <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/">PyCharm</a> for Python and <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/">IntelliJ</a> for Java stuff, and that seems to be doing ok. They all have decent Vim keybindings as well, and good replacements for other functionality &#8211; and I might stick with Atom for a while to see how it goes :)</p>

  <p>Back in Glasgow! It was actually not very cold today, only cold! Progress.</p>

<p>Started working on my long-abandoned <code>labsbook</code> project, which aims to make <a href="https://tools.wmflabs.org">Tool Labs</a> a first class environment for people who want to run (and publish) <a href="http://ipython.org/notebook.html">iPython Notebooks</a> while also being able to access the replica databases and the dumps. Doing this in a secure manner is kinda hard, but I think I&#8217;ve a neat solution that lets everyone run a personal iPython kernel on the Grid, access it from their local machine, and also publish it to the web from a standard location. So far, I&#8217;ve gotten my script to a point where it&#8217;ll setup an iPython environment for you if it doesn&#8217;t already exist, start the kernel if it isn&#8217;t already running, and tunnel the editing interface back to you to use! Things left to do include:</p>

<ol>
<li>Open up the browser when tunnel is open</li>
<li>Find a sane way to kill a kernel that hasn&#8217;t been doing anything since forever</li>
<li>Setup a shared iPython environment (just code, readonly) so people don&#8217;t have to setup their own environments everytime (this is primarily a performance enhancement)</li>
<li>Find a nice and simple way for iPython notebooks to be published. I&#8217;m currently thinking of an URL such as <code>tools.wmflabs.org/notebooks/&lt;username&gt;/&lt;notebookname&gt;' to display them, and an index at</code>tools.wmflabs.org/notebooks/<username>`. This shouldn&#8217;t be too hard with appropriate permission munging.</li>
</ol>

<p>I&#8217;m also using <a href="http://www.paramiko.org/">paramiko</a> for this, which makes writing SSH related code with Python a breeze. It even supports <code>proxycommand</code>! Blunders I&#8217;ve done while getting up to this point include:</p>

<ol>
<li>Running <code>jsub run.bash -mem 4G</code> instead of <code>jsub -mem 4G run.bash</code> and wondering why my script kept getting killed with OOM.</li>
<li>Trying to do a <code>pip install</code> on the Grid nodes (which don&#8217;t have build tools) instead of on <code>tools-dev</code> and wondering why running it from the commandline works but from <code>jsub</code> does not.</li>
<li>Wondering why my SSH Tunnel kept dying and trying to debug that without realizing that it was dying because the iPython process was dying because it was OOMing because of my earlier <code>jsub</code> error</li>
<li>Thinking that user accounts (rather than tool accounts) can not submit jobs to the grid, while the problem was that I had not set the <code>execute</code> bit on my script.</li>
</ol>

<p>Once this is done (I suspect tomorrow), I&#8217;ll work on getting the data from my work with <a href="https://github.com/Ironholds/WPDMZ">WPDMZ</a> into a form good enough for publicizing (removing ways of de-anonymization), and then use iPython notebooks to make graphs! This should be fun :)</p>

<p>Source so far available <a href="https://github.com/yuvipanda/labsbooks">on Github</a>. Needs more work / documentation / cleaning up.</p>

  <p>Was in Edinburgh again, missed writing it as I went along. Oh well.</p>

<ul>
<li>Ported the code for the Wikipedia Android app automated builds to Python, and you can see it in action at <a href="http://tools.wmflabs.org/wikipedia-android-builds/">http://tools.wmflabs.org/wikipedia-android-builds/</a> now. It lets you download the latest build, and notes the last successful build time. Good enough :) It was originally in bash, and porting it to python allowed me to create a &#8216;fake&#8217; API (just JSON blobs written to known locations in the file system). Next step is to write a helper app</li>
<li>The Atom experiment is coming along well. Am using it for most of my Puppet work these days. Should give LightTable another go as well.</li>
</ul>

<p>That&#8217;s it!</p>

  <p>In Edinburgh! I&#8217;ve finally stopped spelling it as Edinborough!</p>

<ul>
<li>Added &#8216;user group&#8217; functionality to Quarry, and added a <code>sudo</code> user group that does what you would think it does. Will be assigned super, super sparingly.</li>
<li>Found out that I&#8217;d have to explicitly specify charset of the database when I&#8217;m creating it or MySQL will default to a stupid charset. Forced all tables and columns to utf8 and that seems to have fixed a bunch of unicode issues. Yay?</li>
<li>Still facing occasional <code>MySQL server has gone away</code> errors with SQLAlchemy for local MySQL instance, despite asking SQLAlchemy to recycle connections every hour or so. Reduced the recycle time to 10m, hopefully that helps.</li>
<li>Read Tony Hoare&#8217;s Turing Award speech from 1980, titled <a href="http://zoo.cs.yale.edu/classes/cs422/2014/bib/hoare81emperor.pdf">&#8220;The Emperor&#8217;s Old Clothes&#8221;</a>. I think I should read more of these papers / speeches, helps keep perspective and &#8216;learn from history&#8217;. Lots of warnings against complexity seem to be a very common theme, and one I&#8217;ve also personally encountered many times. Recommend reading :)</li>
<li>More DMZ work! Now running edits per country stats separated by mobile vs desktop for all countries for all wikipedias! EXCITING!</li>
</ul>

  <p>Woke up at 11AM again! w000t!</p>

<ul>
<li>Fixed a stupid bug in Quarry that made it fail if MySQL decided that a column you were selecting is a <code>Decimal</code>. Fixed this in time for&#8230;</li>
<li>Helped out with a <a href="https://plus.google.com/u/0/b/117126229120807344920/events/cngcjcmm1tcn1omqpalcm686044">webinar</a> from J-Mo for people to learn SQL and do research against Wikimedia stuff with Quarry! Went without a glitch mostly, so yay :) Oren asked for an API for Quarry, I&#8217;ll investigate ways to get that done</li>
<li>Found that some queries against enwiki succeed on <code>s1.labsdb</code> but not on <code>s4.labsdb</code>. I attribute this to cache characteristics, and have switched Quarry to use s1 for now.</li>
<li>Did more work on <a href="https://github.com/Ironholds/WPDMZ">DMZ</a>, getting in place a runner / processor infrastructure and sqlite backed intermediary storage so I can write simpler code to get the data I want. Super excited to see how this goes. It&#8217;ll be much easier for me to add new queries now.</li>
<li>More work on DMZ! I had a late night sprint and split edits by mobile and desktop (and was surprised by seeing how much lesser edits came from mobile). Next would be to gather up population and internet penetration data and then GO MAKE SOME GRAPHS, probably with iPython. I&#8217;m returning to making graphs for real after, what, 6 years or so? :) I was using C# and Excel then :) /nick ExcitedPanda</li>
<li>Also made some progress on our makeshift Android CI-ish build system for the Wikipedia app. Should be done soon.</li>

  <p>Here we go again.</p>

<ul>
<li>Wrote <a href="http://yuvi.in/blog/simple-python-packaging-debian-ubuntu/">a small blog post</a> talking about how to package python packages as debian packages.</li>
<li>More work on getting <a href="https://graphite.readthedocs.org/en/latest/">Graphite</a> setup for Wikimedia Labs. Everything is up and running now (after a number of embarrassing typos). Need to figure out NAT rules to let labs machines talk to <code>labmon1001</code>, and then it can start receiving data!!!1</li>
<li>Got access to Wikimedia&#8217;s <a href="http://hadoop.apache.org/">Hadoop</a> cluster, and ran my first <a href="https://hive.apache.org/">HIVE</a> query ever! This is exciting :)</li>
<li>Made packages for <a href="https://github.com/appliedsec/pygeoip">pygeoip</a> and <a href="https://github.com/tobie/ua-parser">ua-parser</a>. Having to make both trusty and precise packages was fun. I ended up building them on separate machines, but am sure there&#8217;s a simpler way.</li>
<li>Started doing some SQL about editors from different countries. Did you know that there are 2x as many edits to english wikipedia from India as from Germany? And that Wikidata has had 10x as many edits from Toollabs as from Germany (the largest contributing country)? I didn&#8217;t either! This is fun.</li>

  <p>I&#8217;ve started the habit of opening up a devlog post each morning and just filling it up as I go along. Let&#8217;s hope I can keep this up :)</p>

<ul>
<li>Merged a couple of Android patches. The app is getting better every day without too much involvement from me, and yay for that :) I&#8217;ve gotten closure over the Android app &#8211; it was fucking terrible, and now it is quite awesome. Need to write another post about that.</li>
<li>Fixed annoying bug with mysql connections being reset in Quarry&#8217;s query runners after a few hours. I had fixed this earlier when I was using <code>pymysql</code> directly with reconnect(ping=True), and assumed that switching to <a href="http://www.sqlalchemy.org/">SQLAlchemy</a> would&#8217;ve fixed it for me automagically. <a href="http://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/latest/faq.html#mysql-server-has-gone-away">Apparently not</a>. MySQL Y U SO BAD?</li>
<li>I have <code>sudo</code> access on <code>labmon1001</code> in prod! First Wikimedia production cluster machine I have root on, and will spend time over the next few weeks setting it up to run graphite. Should be fun!</li>
<li>Getting slightly better at packaging python things. Packaged <a href="https://github.com/sidnei/txstatsd">python-txstatsd</a> with no lintian errors, and only a couple warnings :)</li>
</ul>

  <p>Devlogs again! Let&#8217;s see how long I can keep this one up.</p>

<p>Been a whirlwind few months. I&#8217;m moving to the Wikimedia Ops team soon! The Wikipedia app has been released! Lots of excitement around, should do a bigger post sometime with details. This should just follow usual devlog format of stuff for the day</p>

<ul>
<li>Completed deployment of changing the results backend of <a href="https://quarry.wmflabs.org">Quarry</a> to SQLite. That was a fun exercise, and I should write about that separately. Still have some unicode issues left (mostly from the MySQL side) that I&#8217;ve hacked around for now.</li>
<li>Quarry now uses a cron based query killer instead of relying on Celery. The day before I had force killed the celery deamons and this meant the query kill tasks didn&#8217;t run, leaving zombie queries behind. The simpler cron based killer won&#8217;t have this issue, since it&#8217;s super simple and does only one thing. The only reason I didn&#8217;t do this before was that I had not known about <code>SHOW PROCESSLIST</code> before (yes, I suck). It seems to be working fine now, but doesn&#8217;t kill superseeded queries immediately. Should be interesting to figure out how to get that done properly.</li>
<li>I&#8217;ve started trying out <a href="https://atom.io">Atom</a> again. My previous attempt ended quickly when I ran into a bug which didn&#8217;t wrap text at all. A restart seems to have fixed that. The Vim keybindings are &#8216;ok&#8217; &#8211; there&#8217;s no <code>hlsearch</code>, which is painful, but I can live with it. I prefer the fuzzy finder in it to Ctrl-P in Vim.</li>
<li>Started working on making labs monitoring with graphite possible again. Our graphite / txstatsd roles weren&#8217;t meant to be run on trusty, so working on porting things to make sure they work fine on both. I&#8217;ve immensely come to appreciate ops over the last year or so, and am quite enjoying my work in that area :) I&#8217;ll probably be doing more of these over the next week, since Quarry has reached a nice state now and I await more usage before I spend more time on it.</li>
<li>Also did some code review on the Android app. It&#8217;s been chugging along quite happily these days :)</li>
<li>Ran into a awake-when-he-should-not-have been <a href="http://blog.ironholds.org/">Oliver Keyes</a> and we have conspired to start some <a href="https://etherpad.wikimedia.org/p/flagellating-funnel">researchy</a> <a href="https://github.com/Ironholds/WPDMZ">things</a>. I cleaned up some of the python code, and am writing out things to do. This should be fun!</li>
