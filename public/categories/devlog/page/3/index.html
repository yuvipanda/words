  <p>I&#8217;ve given up on trying to make DevLogs really comprehensive and complete, and just try to make them &#8211; even if they are incomplete. Perhaps this will help me actually write more devlogs, and thus make it more comprehensive&#8230;</p>

<p>I started on the <a href="https://www.coursera.org/course/progfun">Functional Programming in Scala</a> course today. I wanted to do it the last time, but did not find the time. This time will be different &#8211; I&#8217;m in a different spot mentally, and a big drain on my emotional / time resources (&#8220;college&#8221;) is no longer a factor. I&#8217;ve already gone through the first week&#8217;s lectures (most seem straight ports from <a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/">SICP</a>), and am <sup>2</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub> of my way through the assignments for the first week. Though I&#8217;m normally not fond of the typical types of exercises (&#8220;How many ways can you make change for this scenario?&#8221;), doing them functionally seems to be enough of a twist to keep me interested. The regular languages I seem to work with these days (Java, PHP, Puppet, Python and a bit of JS) aren&#8217;t exactly well tuned to the functional style of programming (except JS, but I don&#8217;t really do that much JS these days) &#8211; so going through this course and hopefully building something in Scala can exercise my &#8216;OMG HOLY SHIT THIS NEW THING IS AWESOME!!1&#8217; muscles.</p>

<p>The course recommends using Scala IDE. Which is Eclipse based. Despite my deep distaste for Eclipse, I&#8217;ve given it a shot and it seems fairly stable and much less shitty than the Eclipse I&#8217;m used to! Let&#8217;s see how that goes.</p>

<p>The way I learn the best seems to be to find a project I want to build, and then build it in a new language. I&#8217;m looking around for fun projects that I could build with Scala, and I&#8217;m pretty sure I&#8217;ll find one at some point. I should also try to diversify the communities I contribute to, so perhaps I should look for a non-Wikimedia project where I can contribute to in Scala. Should be fun :D</p>

<p>Other than that &#8211; I&#8217;ve been <a href="https://bugzilla.wikimedia.org/show_bug.cgi?id=54465">investigating performance problems</a> with the Campaigns API &#8211; turns out Mediawiki&#8217;s Parser is really, really slow. Who would&#8217;ve thought, eh? ;). The &#8216;solution&#8217;, of course &#8211; is to just add more caching. Which is a sortof biggish, hairy-ish problem because of the number of changes that can cause cache invalidation. The way Mediawiki handles caching is&#8230; rather complex &#8211; but that is more due to how much functionality exists rather than anything else. Needs a proper &#8216;clean&#8217; solution that is not just &#8220;Let&#8217;s cache everything for 5 minutes!!!1&#8221;. Should be fun to write up and fix!</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve also been spending time integrating <a href="https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/MediaWiki-Vagrant">Mediawiki-Vagrant</a> with <a href="https://wikitech.wikimedia.org">Wikimedia Labs</a>. This will make it easy for anyone to setup a base mediawiki installation on Labs, and save time dicking around various mundane deployment-of-test-instance issues (did I turn on caching? How do I get this extension on? etc). This is interesting because it merges two different puppet repos &#8211; operations/puppet.git and mediawiki/vagrant.git on one machine and provides different ways of managing them. Since this is also using puppet as a sort of &#8216;deployment&#8217; tool (rather than just a configuration-of-systems tool), that is an interesting / fun aspect too. Should be able to get the <a href="https://gerrit.wikimedia.org/r/#/c/85814/">patch</a> merged in a few weeks.</p>

<p>I visited San Francisco for the last 2 weeks. I don&#8217;t really feel insecure anymore :)</p>

<p>DevLogs have been something I&rsquo;ve not been writing much of of late. Time to fix that!</p>

<h2 id="wlm-android-app">WLM Android App</h2>

<p>Spent some time <a href="http://lists.wikimedia.org/pipermail/wikilovesmonuments/2013-August/006249.html">reviving the WLM Android App</a>. Wasn&rsquo;t too hard, and am surprised at how well it still runs :) Some work still needed to update the <a href="https://github.com/wikimedia/WLMMobile/commit/113d9abf7b675b147ece3f2be005ef1b6ba0e4cf#assets/www/js/campaigns-data.js">templates</a> and other metadata to refer to WLM2013 rather than WLM2012 &#8211; but that should not be too hard. The fact that it is an issue at all is simply because I ripped out all the Campaign related APIs a few weeks ago with my UploadCampaign rewrite.</p>

<p><a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/User:Multichill">multichill</a> was awesome in moving the <a href="https://tools.wmflabs.org/heritage/api/api.php">Monuments API</a> to <a href="https://tools.wmflabs.org">Tool Labs</a> &#8211; hence making it much faster! Initially we thought that the Toollabs DB was too slow for writes &#8211; but this turned out to be a mistake, since apparently the Replica Databases had slow writes, but <code>tools-db</code> itself was fine. There&rsquo;s <a href="https://bugzilla.wikimedia.org/show_bug.cgi?id=48851">a bug</a> tracking this now. Toollabs version of the API still seems much faster to me than Toolserver&rsquo;s :)</p>

<h2 id="uploadcampaigns-api">UploadCampaigns API</h2>

<p>Mediawiki sucks. Eeeew! Specifically, writing API modules &#8211; why can&rsquo;t we just be happy and have everything be JSON? Sigh!</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m adding <a href="https://gerrit.wikimedia.org/r/#/c/80782/">a patch</a> that allows <a href="https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:UploadWizard/Campaigns">UploadCampaigns</a> to be queried selectively, rather than just via the normal page APIs. Right now, this only lets us filter by <code>enabled</code> status &#8211; but in the future, this should be able to also filter on a vast array of other properties. Properties about Geographic location come to mind as the most useful. That patch still has a good way to go before it can be merged (continue support being the foremost one), but it is getting there :)</p>

<p>The ickiest part of the patch is perhaps that it sends out raw JSON data as a&#8230; string. So no matter which format you are using on your client, you <em>need</em> to use a JSON parser to deal with the Campaigns data. This sortof makes sense, since that is how the data is stored anyway. Doesn&rsquo;t make it any less icky, though!</p>

<p>Not bad for a lazy Sunday, eh?</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: After not being able to sleep, I also submitted <a href="https://gerrit.wikimedia.org/r/#/c/80946/">a patch</a> to make phpcs pass for UploadWizard, and also fought with the UploadCampaigns API patch to have it (brokenly?) support continuing. Yay?</p>

<p>When running <a href="http://redis.io/">Redis</a> in a shared cluster/hosting environment (such as <a href="https://wikitech.wikimedia.org/wiki/Nova_Resource:Tools/Help">Wikimedia Tool Labs</a>, on which I&rsquo;ve been having fun doing a lot of work on), you would want to try to provide at least <em>some</em> guarantee of isolation for your keys from everyone else&rsquo;s keys. Since Redis doesn&rsquo;t do ACLs, this is problematic.</p>

<p>This can be solved in a couple of ways</p>

<h2 id="run-a-redis-instance-for-each-user">Run a Redis instance for each user</h2>

<p>This is simple enough to do &#8211; each user runs their own Redis instance, and has full access to it. Security is handled by setting a secret password, and running <code>redis-server</code> as the user in question. Boom, secure!</p>

<p>This doesn&rsquo;t really scale with a large number of users, because they each have lesser memory to work with now. Also having users who just want to run their tools have to deal with making sure their Redis instance is up and running fine isn&rsquo;t really good. Having the sysadmins be responsible for users&rsquo; Redis instance is&#8230; not going to work :) This would also require all the redis instances to run on one box and/or have a separate cluster just for them, which isn&rsquo;t good either.</p>

<h2 id="add-acl-support-to-redis">Add ACL support to Redis</h2>

<p>Not happening, because I&rsquo;m not good enough to do that yet :P But more realistically, it won&rsquo;t ever happen, since this will probably add a lot of overhead for what is arguably an edge case.</p>

<h2 id="build-a-small-server-that-sits-in-front-of-redis">Build a small server that sits in front of Redis</h2>

<p>Such a server would simply authenticate incoming requests via some mechanism (<a href="http://keystone.openstack.org/">Keystone</a> perhaps), and then enforce ACLs. It will have to speak the exact same protocol as Redis, since users should be able to use any library that connects to Redis. This isn&rsquo;t too hard &#8211; just replace the <code>password</code> functionality of Redis protocol to take in both a username and password (or token, or some other method of auth).</p>

<p>This also I discarded &#8211; it will still affect performance, which will now be limited by how fast <em>this</em> server runs, and that is definitely not faster than Redis. And it will also be hard to maintain, since I&rsquo;ll have to completely mimic Redis&rsquo; protocol and make sure it is kept up to date. Debugging protocol issues with random client libraries is not my idea of fun. Another <strong>major</strong> disadvantage is that <strong>I</strong> would now be writing auth code, and I don&rsquo;t think handrolling auth code is a good idea, ever.</p>

<h2 id="security-by-obscurity">Security By Obscurity!</h2>

<p>This is what we finally settled on :D It sounds horrible by the title, but I think it is Good Enough<sup>TM</sup>.</p>

<p>Since Redis is a key value store at heart, you can do anything once you know the key. So, if an &lsquo;attacker&rsquo; doesn&rsquo;t know the key, there isn&rsquo;t much they can do. So it can be considered SecureEnough for our purposes if we can make it so that other users can not find out or guess your keys.</p>

<p>We essentially did so with the following:</p>

<ol>
<li>Disable all Redis commands that let users list all / many keys.</li>
<li>Have users use a random and long key prefix for all their keys.</li>
</ol>

<p>(1) prevents someone from just listing all keys to find something interesting. (2) prevents people from brute-forcing or guessing keys. Since all code run on Tool Labs must be open source, guessing keys is super easy. By having a &lsquo;secret&rsquo; prefix, having the actual keys is useless. This also prevents accidental key overwrites from different tools using a common key name.</p>

<p>Disabling commands is easy to do by using Redis&rsquo; <code>RENAME COMMAND</code> config feature. I added support for <code>RENAME COMMAND</code> to Wikimedia&rsquo;s <a href="https://github.com/wikimedia/operations-puppet/tree/production/modules/redis">Redis puppet module</a>, and then it was simple enough to <a href="https://github.com/wikimedia/operations-puppet/blob/production/modules/toollabs/manifests/redis.pp">configure</a> a specific instance to disable &lsquo;list keys&rsquo; type commands. That&rsquo;s the following commands:</p>

<ol>
<li><code>CONFIG</code></li>
<li><code>FLUSHALL</code></li>
<li><code>FLUSHDB</code></li>
<li><code>KEYS</code></li>
<li><code>SHUTDOWN</code></li>
<li><code>SLAVEOF</code></li>
<li><code>CLIENT</code></li>
<li><code>RANDOMKEY</code></li>
<li><code>DEBUG</code>.</li>
</ol>

<p>After going through the list of Redis commands, I am guessing this is going to be GoodEnough to prevent key listing. (Note: if there&rsquo;s more that I&rsquo;m missing, please, <em>please</em> let me know).</p>

<p>We also tell people to use a secure prefix that&rsquo;s at least 64bytes long, saved in a file that is only user readable. Generating that is as simple as:</p>

<p>openssl rand -base64 64</p>

<p>That should be long enough to be hard to brute force, even with Redis being as fast as it is.</p>

<h3 id="problems">Problems</h3>

<p>The major problem with this is, of course &#8211; the fact that humans are involved :) I&rsquo;ve heard &ldquo;I do not care about my keys, do not need security&rdquo; a fair amount of times already. The fact that the prefix generation is optional means that there will be people who do not use prefixes, and it will work for them for a (probably) long time &#8211; until it doesn&rsquo;t, and they have no idea why. This is personally acceptable to me, since they have been made aware of the risks beforehand.</p>

<h2 id="fun">Fun</h2>

<p>This has now been deployed on toollabs for a month or so, and I&rsquo;ve a couple of fun tools already written using it (and other people too). We had a patched memcached server we had that we&rsquo;ll kill in a few weeks, so people who used memcached before are also migrating to redis. And I was able to do all this without even having root! This is mostly thanks to the fact that we try to keep all our configuration in puppet (<a href="https://github.com/wikimedia/operations-puppet">Wikimedia&rsquo;s Puppet repository</a>) &#8211; for both our production cluster and for everything else. So I could re-use our production redis module, make changes to it, and build the new solution &#8211; all while being vetted by &lsquo;proper&rsquo; ops people (whom I dearly love and respect). Building infrastructure in such a collaborative manner is a lot of fun, and I think I&rsquo;m hooked. It&rsquo;s fun!</p>

  <p>Back in Chennai</p>

<ol>
<li>Moving yuvi.in to my <a href="http://prgmr.com">prgmr</a> server. I want wordpress for my blog, but I don&#8217;t want to run MySQL. Solution? Keep blog where it is (with the awesome <a href="http://webfaction.com">webfaction</a> people!) and use <a href="http://nginx.org">nginx</a> to proxy requests to blog/. Seems to work, so yay!</li>
<li>Rewrote tawp.in to use python/flask/memcached. Available on github. Replaced older node.js version</li>
<li>Reading through _The Art of Unix Programming_ on kindle. Amazing book so far.</li>
<li>Fixed a few more bugs on Wikipedia App. I think I&#8217;ll keep &#8216;official&#8217; Wiki related stuff off this, unless it&#8217;s big?</li>
<li>Partied along new year&#8217;s. Yay. Not particularly &#8216;dev&#8217;, but still :)</li>

  <p>Worked the day first from Domlur bus terminus, and then from Exotel&#8217;s office (with @vijaysw).</p>

<ul>
<li>Incorporated search results (rather than just suggestions) into the Wikipedia app. Was a slight bitch to get right, but after that have made a bunch of variants that the others are testing out to see which one feels good (Suggestion if exists, else search, or search alone). Took up most of my time.</li>
<li>We put out a dud as RC3 for the Wikipedia app. A missing defaults statement. Lesson learnt: Test the entire process (uninstall -&gt; install -&gt; run -&gt; test) before passing off RCs</li>
<li>HyperJuice battery has arrived. Commence working out of random public places.</li>

<li>livetrains work. Trying to move (minimal) build system to waf. Somewhat complicated, not as fluid as I&#8217;d like. Go to rake. Feel weird about starting from scratch, come back to waf. Not get anything done Another rake diversion. Final Makefile editing desperation. I give up &#8211; I need to spend atleast a day to get back on proper build tools. That day is not today.

<ol>
<li>Added feature to change font size to wikipedia app. That took almost a couple of days and ended up being less than 20 lines of code. First was trying to enable pinch and zoom, but only for an iframe &#8211; proved impossible. And then a long time of headwalling about how I&#8217;m not able to manipulate the DOM inside the iframe (despite code in other places being able to do it just fine (no crossdomain issues here)), I had given up and moved elsewhere. Finally brion suggested I try inserting a <link> into <head>, which actually did work. So much for the browser being sane</li>
<li>&#8216;Refined&#8217; the search behavior of the wikipedia app a bit more. Also got bit by a difference between zepto (that we use) and jQuery (whose docs I have to read, since zepto by itself seems to have no docs). Had to read through the code to fix it, and managed to.</li>
<li>Closed a *lot* of bugs. BOY THAT FEELS GREAT!</li>

<li>Added UI for AssessmentLog [SelectionSifter]

<ol>
<li>Removed lots of dead code in SelectionSifter.</li>
<li>Went to Bangalore Wikipedia Meetup. Was nice meeting people I knew online face to face. Talked about yenWikipedia, and learnt a lot about how article selection for offline wikipedia is done.</li>
<li>Shot myself in the foot multiple times (over use of empty(), incomplete commit summaries and a tab/spaces issue). I&#8217;m rusty and it is showing. Shouldn&#8217;t be a problem anymore, though &#8211; because of you-know-what.</li>
<li>Built myself a local copy of mediawiki docs. No more annoying huge-images.</li>
<li>Got myself the solarized theme. And increased font size to normal levels (13pt). My eyes thank me.</li>
<li>Fixed timestamp related bugs in SelectionSifter.</li>
</ol></li>

<li>Looks like I&#8217;m going to be rewriting SelectionSifter&#8217;s UI a lot. No more QuickTemplates, as I found TablePager. Mediawik definitely needs to fix <a href="https://bugzilla.wikimedia.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1">Bug #1</a> soon.

<ol>
<li>Added proper i18n for SelectionSifter.</li>
<li>Redid FilterRatings page completely.</li>
<li>Went through PhoneGap documentation, checked out state of its Photo handling API. Looks good.</li>
<li>Checked out <a href="https://github.com/Tpt/Wikipedia">patch</a> to official Wikipedia app that adds upload functionality. Needs lot more polish.</li>
</ol></li>
