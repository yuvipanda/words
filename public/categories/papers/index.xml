      <description>&lt;p&gt;I’ve recently started reading more academic papers, and thought it’d be useful to write notes about them and publish them as I go along! This one is for &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ppig.org/sites/default/files/2015-PPIG-26th-Sarkar.pdf&#34;&gt;The impact of syntax colouring on program comprehension&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;I was amazed at the amount of prior research it is citing. Why have I not been reading these for the last 10 years of my life?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Apparently it is ok to report findings with a sample size of 10 people. I do not know how I feel about this.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The fact that there’s a large amount of thought put into the design of the experiment is quite nice, and surprisingly different from environments I’ve worked in the past where product managers designed ‘experiments’&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;To avoid datatype-related confusion, a uniform variable naming scheme was adopted in the tasks. For example, integers were named x, y, etc. and lists were named list1, list2, etc.&lt;/code&gt;. As someone pretty used to Python, I would have found this annoying – but I’m curious what the effect of identifier names is in program comprehension. It also reminded me I haven’t written any code in a stronger typed language in a while (I don’t think Java counts)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;They used Solarized Color Scheme, which has a lot of fans although I’ve never been one.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Lots of self-reporting for ‘programming proficiency’. This is the ‘we give up!’ answer to measuring programming proficiency, I guess :)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;We gathered data from 10 graduate computer science students at the University of Cambridge.&lt;/code&gt; This too seems fairly common, but I’ve no idea if such an un-diverse group of student group being studied affects the results at all?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;They also discarded data from 3 of the students because they wore glasses and their eye-tracking hardware could not really deal with that. So this entire paper is from data from 7 students doing one particular course from one particular university.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;We use the Shapiro-Wilk test to establish normality. We use the Wilcoxon signed rank test (WSRT) for paired nonparametric comparisons&lt;/code&gt;. I know some of these words!&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;As the data was not normally distributed, a 2-way ANNOVA could not be used to investigate the interaction of experience with highlighting on task times&lt;/code&gt; I know &lt;em&gt;most&lt;/em&gt; of the words, but still can not make sense of this sentence.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Currently feeling very illiterate, but am sure this is just a feeling that will pass.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;. The median difference in task completion time was 8.4s in favour of highlighting.&lt;/code&gt; To my untrained brain, that does not seem that much to me.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;The presence of syntax highlighting significantly reduces task completion time, but the magnitude of this effect decreases as programming experience increase&lt;/code&gt; – this is their primary conclusion, which I can totally believe. But would I have believed it if they had come to a different conclusion? Would they have published it if it had? Would they have if there was more data? I don’t fully understand / know Academia enough to know.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;I wonder if there has been research into richer forms of syntax highlighting – not just keyword based ones, but more contextual. Perhaps based on types (autodetected?), or scope, or usage frequency, or source, or whatever.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Overall, I enjoyed reading it – good paper! Thought provoking in some forms, but could’ve aimed higher, I suppose. I hope they continue doing good work!&lt;/p&gt;</description>
