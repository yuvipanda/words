  <p>I&#8217;m writing this post in an attempt to catalog the list of things I own so I can evaluate if I really need them and get rid of them.</p>

<p>Decluttering actions:</p>

<ol>

  <p>Was a great idea! It just worked (with an OTP cable), and I can now probably find much more uses for this thing than I could before. Yay!</p>

<p>I wonder if I can use this to write code. However, a 7 inch tablet is very poorly suited for that task &#8211; would need at least a 10&#8243; one. But there aren&#8217;t many of those going around these days&#8230;</p>

<p>I&#8217;ll probably use this for random browsing / commenting, and use my Mac for actual programming.</p>

  <p>In <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welcome_to_the_Machine">Welcome to the Machine</a> there is a line that goes &#8220;provided with toys and scouting for boys&#8221;. I had initially assumed that it was referring to a young guy who is gay and is &#8216;scouting for boys&#8217;.</p>

<p>And then a few days later I realized that it is talking about &#8216;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scouting_for_Boys">the book</a>&#8216;. That is now doubly funny because of the Boy Scouts&#8217; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boy_Scouts_of_America_membership_controversies#Position_on_homosexuality">attitude towards gays</a></p>

  <p>[Warning: Childish rant ahead]</p>

<p>My natural sleep cycle seems to be one that tends towards the darker times &#8211; sleeping before 3AM feels like an abomination, before midnight unheard of. My best work seems to be done between 2AM and 5AM. My current &lsquo;sleep cycle&rsquo; has me sleeping at about 8AM, and waking up at about 5PM. Plenty of sleep for the day, eh?</p>

<p>It is probably not healthy. I don&rsquo;t look, or feel healthy. But that is the way it is.</p>

<p>SO IT FUCKING SUCKS WHEN THE POWER GOES OUT AT MIDNIGHT, BECAUSE I HAD JUST STARTED GETTING SHIT DONE. AND THEN YOUR PHONE REFUSES TO TETHER INTERNET, BECAUSE FUCKING ASSHOLES. AND THEN THE POWER COMES BACK AFTER THREE FUCKING HOURS AND YOU STILL CAN NOT GET ON THE INTERNET BECAUSE THE FUCKING LINE IS DEAD. IT IS MIDNIGHT AND YOU ARE IN FUCKING CHENNAI SO YOU CAN NOT EVEN GET THE FUCK OUT OF THIS PRISON. YOU CAN NOT SLEEP BECAUSE YOU JUST WOKE UP. FUCK THIS SHIT.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m scarily addicted to the internet. All my friends are there.</p>

  <p>I&rsquo;ve been on the Internet since I was 14. And I don&rsquo;t remember a time when I did not have a computer &#8211; I think I got mine when I was 10. Growing up, writing code has always been a major part of me &#8211; my identity. I&rsquo;ve never quite managed to separate &lsquo;me&rsquo; from &lsquo;my code&rsquo; &#8211; despite mouthing off the soundbite &lsquo;You are not your code!&rsquo; to plenty of people.</p>

<p>After Wikimania 2013, I spent a week in Hong Kong. The first few days were rough, but after that &#8211; it was amazing. For the first time I could imagine, I had completely managed to not think about code at all! I had my laptop locked in a locker somewhere, and didn&rsquo;t even bother getting to it. I didn&rsquo;t feel the burning urge to make a commit. The feeling of guilt that keeps gnawing at you from the back of the head &lsquo;teehee you have been so unproductive today!&rsquo;.</p>

<p>That was a rather great feeling. Put things into a little bit more perspective. A step towards separating my identity from my code. I gave up on my GitHub streaks after that. I&rsquo;ll probably also be less of a codeaholic.</p>

<p>I could write about &lsquo;oh my god, this was amazing!&rsquo; and detail where I travelled in Hong Kong, but I think what was far more fascinating was <em>how</em>. I did not feel in a hurry. Did not feel like having to &lsquo;tick all boxes&rsquo; before leaving. Just&#8230; actually relaxing. And doing whatever.</p>

<p>Vacations are good :)</p>

  <p>I&rsquo;m on my <a href="https://github.com/yuvipanda">longest</a> GitHub Streak this year &#8211; currently 20 days (was previously 18 days). That means I&rsquo;ve had at least one commit (though usually more!) each day for the last 20 days. Sounds much easier than it actually is. Wanting to keep my streak unbroken is also making me write more diverse code &#8211; I think those 20 days feature code in Javascript, Python, Java, PHP and Python. It&rsquo;s also distributed across a lot of projects &#8211; at least 8-9 different ones on last count. Streaks are helping me a fair bit! Getting the first commit of the day is the hardest &#8211; seems to get easier to keep things after.</p>

<p>So I&rsquo;ve beat my previous streak length for this year (18 days). Next step would be to get over the awesome/scarily productive <a href="https://github.com/legoktm">legoktm</a>&rsquo;s longest streak (29 days). Eventual goal would be to match <a href="https://github.com/atdt">ori-l</a> at some point in productivity.</p>

  <p>Ever since the death of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Live_Writer">Windows Live Writer</a>, I&#8217;ve never managed to find a nice blog editor that I really liked and also worked fine. I had a nice Vim plugin that posted to wordpress for a while, but that seems to have stopped working. The WordPress interface itself is mostly fine, but still a fair bit &#8216;meh&#8217;.</p>

<p><a href="http://tatiyants.com/introducing-platen-markdown-wordpress-editor-2/">Platen</a> is a markdown based editor that&#8217;s a Chrome Web Store app that looks cool so far. Let me see if it actually works.</p>
