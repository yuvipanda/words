  <p>I was writing a post on how 2009 ended. Here is the tl;dr version: It was my ‘growing-up’ year in Tech, and ‘roller-coaster’ year in personal stuff. There! I’m certainly significantly wiser at the end of 2009, and that is due more to my state at the beginning of 2009 than at the end :) Good enough</p>
<p>So how did I celebrate? By joining the KPP <em>competition</em> at Kurukshetra. That’s what I did at around 12 on New Year’s. Not intentionally, mind you. Just happened.</p>
<p>Then, on 2nd Jan, I did something interesting. On a whim, I took my bicycle, and rode an hour in traffic. Alone. To Marina Beach.</p>
<p>And then I spent the next hour sitting near the waves. Looking around. Just enjoying myself. And then rode back home, and for the first time in over 4 years, slept before 12.</p>
<p>I did it again the next day. With a friend this time. My knees were already killing me since I practically had no physical activity before this. But I still did it again. My knees would literally kill me now if they had a way to.</p>
<p>I’m happy. Teen Angst has taken a break :)</p>
<p>Let this year be the one when I remove external dependencies on my happiness :)</p>

  <p>Commitment.</p>
<p>I keep jumping around. My <a href="http://github.com/yuvipanda">GitHub</a> profile is proof for that. So are the large number of projects I’ve taken up only to leave in the middle. Unless and until I fix my commitment issues, I’ll be just-another-guy-who-learnt-to-code-in-his-teens, not the-guy-who-changed-the-world. Just reading a lot of stuff isn’t going to do me <em>any</em> good unless I actually get off my ass and do something.</p>
<p>Hopefully, putting this up in public will make it more real. Maybe I’ll be shamed into being more committed to whatever I choose to commit to.</p>
<p>It is good to jump ship when it is sinking, as long as you know where you want to go.</p>

  <p>So, I wake up at noon.</p>
<p>And my phone doesn’t work.</p>
<p>Then I find out my Internet doesn’t work.</p>
<p>Then I find my TV’s crapped.</p>
<p>Then I find that I’ve to go to college tomorrow.</p>
<p>The last thing is good. The others aren’t. Oh well.</p>

  <p>I was about to just type a list of stuff here, but that doesn’t do the topic justice. So here I am, at 3:30 in the morning, sleep cycle screwed up by the Hackfest, typing out a post on what all I learnt from there. I spent pretty much my entire awake-time at the IIT, so it helped me a lot.</p>
<h4 id="your-college-doesn8217t-matter-much">Your college doesn’t matter much</h4>
<p>IIT Envy. Every non-IITian has that. I spent a lot of time at IITM during the Hackfest, and while my IITEnvy did go up during the first few hours, it initially came down well below normal as I got to know the people better. What was cool about them was not <em>where they were studying</em>, but <em>what they were doing</em>. I could do what these guys were doing. Anyone can do what these guys were doing – there is nothing special about the IIT except maybe for the fact that it aggregates naturally dedicated people into pools. You don’t need an IIT for that – IRC will do :) I’m from a teeny college that nobody has heard of – that would have been a problem when people judged people by where they studied, rather than by what they did. Should not be a problem for me now :)</p>
<h4 id="real-c-isn8217t-hard">Real C isn’t hard</h4>
<p>I was utterly clueless about GTK+ when I landed up at the IIT. The first thing I told <a href="http://arun.chagantys.org/blog/">Arun</a> was that I was clueless about C and maybe would like to hack on something in C# or Python.</p>
<p>I thought I was clueless about C. All I had done was TurboC – which I had not really considered as <em>real</em> C till that point. However, an hour into the hackfest, I realized something – Pointers and Structures are all you need! Read the docs, read some good code, and you are done. I will probably do what I usually do to learn a new language – write a significant amount of useful code in it – in C very soon.</p>
<h4 id="code-talks">Code talks</h4>
<p>I don’t have any patches against my name. The only significant piece of code I think I have written so far is this blogging engine you are reading. That needs to change.</p>
<p>Doesn’t mean I have to churn out code like a copier machine – I just have to have enough things to point to and be able to proudly say ‘I did that’. Great Documentation, proper deployment options and a little evangelism helps too. None of my code has any of that. That has to change too.</p>
<h4 id="know-tools-well">Know tools well</h4>
<p>I use Emacs. But not to its fullest potential. Same thing for pretty much all of my tools – Bash/Powershell, Build Tools, etc. Heck, I can’t even write a shell script to save my life! That has to change, and change fast. I smell perl.</p>
<h4 id="people-on-irc-are-friendly">People on IRC are friendly</h4>
<p>I’ve always been a lurker on IRC, just listening and not daring to speak. That changed <em>drastically</em> once I actually met these really nice people in person – so I can see my IRC usage going way up! It has also expanded my horizons quite a bit – meeting new people, getting to know people better, constantly being challenged to actually get off my ass and write some stuff, etc.</p>
<h4 id="todo">TODO</h4>
<ul>
<li>Read more code. File bugs. Try to fix bugs.</li>
<li>Learn Perl. Learn C. Learn C++. Get much better at Python.</li>
<li>Go through my <a href="http://github.com/yuvipanda">code</a>, document all the necessary parts, create home pages for the significant ones.</li>
<li>IRC more. I have been – the last two days have seen my IRC usage skyrocket.</li>
<li>Stop cribbing about my life and get on with it!</li>
</ul>

  <p>Code I have written so far:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="http://github.com/yuvipanda/HiSlain">HiSlain</a>: A static blog publishing system (NOT A DJANGO BLOG!). Runs this blog</li>
<li><a href="http://github.com/yuvipanda/wtfimb">wtfimb</a>: The code that powers <a href="http://busroutes.in">Busroutes.in</a></li>
<li><a href="http://github.com/yuvipanda/frailgrey">frailgrey</a>: Markov Chain based page generator (pretty lame, actually)</li>
<li><a href="http://github.com/yuvipanda/goodfather">GoodFather</a>: Collection of utils for web data scraping and storing</li>

<li><a href="http://github.com/yuvipanda/sadivy">SadIvy</a>: A pure WSGI URL Shortener</li>
</ol>
<p>Now, I’ve been doing a shit job of documenting them – none exists. Nor of writing tests – none exists. That should hopefully change soon :)</p>
<p>HiSlain and reappy are where I’m going to concentrate my efforts on for the next month or so.</p>
<h4 id="task-list-for-hislain">Task List for HiSlain</h4>
<ul>
<li>Refactor code, clean it up so it doesn’t look like proof for the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinite_monkey_theorem">Infinite Monkey Theorem</a></li>
<li>Add support for raw, unmanaged pages</li>
<li>Port a decent looking, simple theme to HiSlain</li>
<li>WRITE DOCUMENTATION!</li>
<li>Write some tests, and refactor the code to make it more testable</li>
<li>WRITE MORE DOCUMENTATION!</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="task-list-for-reappy">Task List for reappy</h4>
<ul>
<li>Write a real application with it, so bugs can be fixed in the process</li>
<li>DOCUMENTATION!</li>
<li>Write some tests and refactor the code to make it more testable</li>
<li>MORE DOCUMENTATION!</li>
<li>Examples.</li>
</ul>
<p>And ofcourse, new sub-pages over here for both of them (atleast). Stay tuned!</p>

  <p>Those are my new goals.</p>
<p>I’ve got a mechanism to track the code accomplishments (will make that public soon), and maybe I’ll write a widget for HiSlain for the blog post/day accomplishment.</p>
<p>I’m liking it so far – 7 hours of code yesterday, along with 2 blog posts. Couldn’t hit my code target today – but am hitting my blog target. I should figure out more ways to make this work better.</p>
<p>Let’s see how much I could stick to it.</p>

<p>Her waitress uniform made her look cuter than ever. He knew he had to ask her out. He drummed up enough courage, went to her and said ‘Hi’.</p>
<p>She turned, gave him a cute smile, and replied ‘Hello uncle, what can I do for you?’</p>
