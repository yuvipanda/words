  <p>I was writing a post on how 2009 ended. Here is the tl;dr version: It was my &#8216;growing-up&#8217; year in Tech, and &#8216;roller-coaster&#8217; year in personal stuff. There! I&#8217;m certainly significantly wiser at the end of 2009, and that is due more to my state at the beginning of 2009 than at the end :) Good enough</p>

<p>So how did I celebrate? By joining the KPP <em>competition</em> at Kurukshetra. That&#8217;s what I did at around 12 on New Year&#8217;s. Not intentionally, mind you. Just happened.</p>

<p>Then, on 2nd Jan, I did something interesting. On a whim, I took my bicycle, and rode an hour in traffic. Alone. To Marina Beach.</p>

<p>And then I spent the next hour sitting near the waves. Looking around. Just enjoying myself. And then rode back home, and for the first time in over 4 years, slept before 12.</p>

<p>I did it again the next day. With a friend this time. My knees were already killing me since I practically had no physical activity before this. But I still did it again. My knees would literally kill me now if they had a way to.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m happy. Teen Angst has taken a break :)</p>

<p>Let this year be the one when I remove external dependencies on my happiness :)</p>

  <p>Commitment.</p>

<p>I keep jumping around. My <a href="http://github.com/yuvipanda">GitHub</a> profile is proof for that. So are the large number of projects I&#8217;ve taken up only to leave in the middle. Unless and until I fix my commitment issues, I&#8217;ll be just-another-guy-who-learnt-to-code-in-his-teens, not the-guy-who-changed-the-world. Just reading a lot of stuff isn&#8217;t going to do me <em>any</em> good unless I actually get off my ass and do something.</p>

<p>Hopefully, putting this up in public will make it more real. Maybe I&#8217;ll be shamed into being more committed to whatever I choose to commit to.</p>

<p>It is good to jump ship when it is sinking, as long as you know where you want to go.</p>

  <p>So, I wake up at noon.</p>

<p>And my phone doesn&#8217;t work.</p>

<p>Then I find out my Internet doesn&#8217;t work.</p>

<p>Then I find my TV&#8217;s crapped.</p>

<p>Then I find that I&#8217;ve to go to college tomorrow.</p>

<p>The last thing is good. The others aren&#8217;t. Oh well.</p>

<p>I was about to just type a list of stuff here, but that doesn&#8217;t do the topic justice. So here I am, at 3:30 in the morning, sleep cycle screwed up by the Hackfest, typing out a post on what all I learnt from there. I spent pretty much my entire awake-time at the IIT, so it helped me a lot.</p>

<h4 id="your-college-doesn-8217-t-matter-much">Your college doesn&#8217;t matter much</h4>

<p>IIT Envy. Every non-IITian has that. I spent a lot of time at IITM during the Hackfest, and while my IITEnvy did go up during the first few hours, it initially came down well below normal as I got to know the people better. What was cool about them was not <em>where they were studying</em>, but <em>what they were doing</em>. I could do what these guys were doing. Anyone can do what these guys were doing &#8211; there is nothing special about the IIT except maybe for the fact that it aggregates naturally dedicated people into pools. You don&#8217;t need an IIT for that &#8211; IRC will do :) I&#8217;m from a teeny college that nobody has heard of &#8211; that would have been a problem when people judged people by where they studied, rather than by what they did. Should not be a problem for me now :)</p>

<h4 id="real-c-isn-8217-t-hard">Real C isn&#8217;t hard</h4>

<p>I was utterly clueless about GTK+ when I landed up at the IIT. The first thing I told <a href="http://arun.chagantys.org/blog/">Arun</a> was that I was clueless about C and maybe would like to hack on something in C# or Python.</p>

<p>I thought I was clueless about C. All I had done was TurboC &#8211; which I had not really considered as <em>real</em> C till that point. However, an hour into the hackfest, I realized something &#8211; Pointers and Structures are all you need! Read the docs, read some good code, and you are done. I will probably do what I usually do to learn a new language &#8211; write a significant amount of useful code in it &#8211; in C very soon.</p>

<h4 id="code-talks">Code talks</h4>

<p>I don&#8217;t have any patches against my name. The only significant piece of code I think I have written so far is this blogging engine you are reading. That needs to change.</p>

<p>Doesn&#8217;t mean I have to churn out code like a copier machine &#8211; I just have to have enough things to point to and be able to proudly say &#8216;I did that&#8217;. Great Documentation, proper deployment options and a little evangelism helps too. None of my code has any of that. That has to change too.</p>

<h4 id="know-tools-well">Know tools well</h4>

<p>I use Emacs. But not to its fullest potential. Same thing for pretty much all of my tools &#8211; Bash/Powershell, Build Tools, etc. Heck, I can&#8217;t even write a shell script to save my life! That has to change, and change fast. I smell perl.</p>

<h4 id="people-on-irc-are-friendly">People on IRC are friendly</h4>

<p>I&#8217;ve always been a lurker on IRC, just listening and not daring to speak. That changed <em>drastically</em> once I actually met these really nice people in person &#8211; so I can see my IRC usage going way up! It has also expanded my horizons quite a bit &#8211; meeting new people, getting to know people better, constantly being challenged to actually get off my ass and write some stuff, etc.</p>

<h4 id="todo">TODO</h4>

<ul>
<li>Read more code. File bugs. Try to fix bugs.</li>
<li>Learn Perl. Learn C. Learn C++. Get much better at Python.</li>
<li>Go through my <a href="http://github.com/yuvipanda">code</a>, document all the necessary parts, create home pages for the significant ones.</li>
<li>IRC more. I have been &#8211; the last two days have seen my IRC usage skyrocket.</li>
<li>Stop cribbing about my life and get on with it!</li>
</ul>

<p>Code I have written so far:</p>

<ol>
<li><a href="http://github.com/yuvipanda/HiSlain">HiSlain</a>: A static blog publishing system (NOT A DJANGO BLOG!). Runs this blog</li>
<li><a href="http://github.com/yuvipanda/wtfimb">wtfimb</a>: The code that powers <a href="http://busroutes.in">Busroutes.in</a></li>
<li><a href="http://github.com/yuvipanda/frailgrey">frailgrey</a>: Markov Chain based page generator (pretty lame, actually)</li>
<li><a href="http://github.com/yuvipanda/goodfather">GoodFather</a>: Collection of utils for web data scraping and storing</li>
<li><a href="http://github.com/yuvipanda/reappy">reappy</a>: A Twitter Search Application Framework</li>
<li><a href="http://github.com/yuvipanda/sadivy">SadIvy</a>: A pure WSGI URL Shortener</li>
</ol>

<p>Now, I&#8217;ve been doing a shit job of documenting them &#8211; none exists. Nor of writing tests &#8211; none exists. That should hopefully change soon :)</p>

<p>HiSlain and reappy are where I&#8217;m going to concentrate my efforts on for the next month or so.</p>

<h4 id="task-list-for-hislain">Task List for HiSlain</h4>

<ul>
<li>Refactor code, clean it up so it doesn&#8217;t look like proof for the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinite_monkey_theorem">Infinite Monkey Theorem</a></li>
<li>Add support for raw, unmanaged pages</li>
<li>Port a decent looking, simple theme to HiSlain</li>
<li>WRITE DOCUMENTATION!</li>
<li>Write some tests, and refactor the code to make it more testable</li>
<li>WRITE MORE DOCUMENTATION!</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="task-list-for-reappy">Task List for reappy</h4>

<ul>
<li>Write a real application with it, so bugs can be fixed in the process</li>
<li>DOCUMENTATION!</li>
<li>Write some tests and refactor the code to make it more testable</li>
<li>MORE DOCUMENTATION!</li>
<li>Examples.</li>
</ul>

<p>And ofcourse, new sub-pages over here for both of them (atleast). Stay tuned!</p>

  <p>Those are my new goals.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve got a mechanism to track the code accomplishments (will make that public soon), and maybe I&#8217;ll write a widget for HiSlain for the blog post/day accomplishment.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m liking it so far &#8211; 7 hours of code yesterday, along with 2 blog posts. Couldn&#8217;t hit my code target today &#8211; but am hitting my blog target. I should figure out more ways to make this work better.</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s see how much I could stick to it.</p>

<p>Her waitress uniform made her look cuter than ever. He knew he had to ask her out. He drummed up enough courage, went to her and said &#8216;Hi&#8217;.</p>

<p>She turned, gave him a cute smile, and replied &#8216;Hello uncle, what can I do for you?&#8217;</p>
