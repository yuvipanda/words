  <p>I&#8217;ve been mostly off Twitter for a while now, interacting with it rarely, and only on my Phone. While I&#8217;ve had a vague feeling of uneasiness ever since they unveiled their now <a href="https://dev.twitter.com/terms/api-terms"><em>business friendly</em> developer policies</a>, it really hit home when my favorite Android twitter app, Falcon Pro, hit <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/2/23/4021380/falcon-for-android-hits-twitter-token-limit">Twitter&#8217;s arbitrary user token limit</a> (and Twitter declined to care). That, plus the Google Reader saga have jolted me out of complacency a bit.</p>

<p>It may be cliche, but &#8220;If you are not paying for it, you are the product&#8221; rings rather true at the moment.</p>

<p>So I&#8217;ll mostly be off Twitter (and Facebook too) now. Identi.ca seems inactive, but I will probably give it a shot too. I&#8217;m going to pick up the slack by actually blogging instead. Twitter seems to have completely killed my long form text writing ability. My Nexus 7 and bluetooth keyboard will hopefully help bring it back! Twitter is still good for publicity, so I&#8217;ll need to find a way to feed my blog links into Twitter.</p>

  <p>Should have done this a while back. Added a <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/deed.en_US">CC BY</a> mark to the blog. Will add a notice to the front page as well, stating that all media I produce (when not bound to someone else&#8217;s copyright) is CC BY. I think code is already taken care of, but I&#8217;ll add a note here saying that all code I release (unless explicitly licensed otherwise) is CC0 Licensed.</p>

<p>Now to actually produce something of value&#8230;</p>

  <p>Reading <a href="http://wilwheaton.net/2011/12/from-the-vault-the-irrational-immortality-of-youth/">this blog post</a> from <del>Wesley Crusher</del><ins>Wil Wheaton</ins> reminded me first of my visit to the beach a few hours before <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclone_Nilam">Cyclone Nilam</a> hit landfall (at the Thiruvanmiyur Beach). The fact that I couldn&#8217;t stand in one place (wind) and was constantly being attacked by sand &#8211; it was exhilarating.</p>

<p>The blog post also reminded me of how much I mis-treat my body. I&#8217;m surprised I&#8217;m not bedridden, immovable and with a host of diseases. Trading health for a wealth of incredible stories.</p>

<p>Immortality of youth, or plain old luck. Hopefully I&#8217;ll wisen up before either of them run out.</p>

  <p>I left Chennai on the 3rd of November. I (will be) leaving Delhi on the 4th of December. That&#8217;s a 31 day trip. It taught me to be optimistic. It taught me in very real terms that the world is a large place, and so is life.</p>

<p>A few highlights:</p>

<ul>
<li>Building an app from nothing to workable state in a few days</li>
<li>An actual first class train ride in India</li>
<li>Running into a bunch of random french people who ended up becoming travel buddies</li>
<li>Feeling small, and very temporary being in the ruins of Hampi. Here was a civilization that used to be great, reduced to rubble visited by 2-3 tourists a year. Our Data centers and Washington Monuments will be similar in a few hundred / thousand years. &#8220;The one thing a man can not truly have, is perspective&#8221; &#8211; DA.</li>
<li>The best lassi money can buy</li>
<li>First train ticket that was confirmed after being waitlisted</li>
<li>RAVE!</li>
<li>The scenery at the Goa Beaches</li>
<li>Learning to float in the ocean. ZOMG THIS IS AWESOME!</li>
<li>Pulling a passed out guy out of the ocean, and seeing how other locals react to that.</li>
<li>Watching Rob Moen try to negotiate with the local hawkers</li>
<li>Stopping at a Pharmacy every time we get into an Auto with Rob Moen</li>
<li>Being annoyed at Jon Robson&#8217;s eternal optimism,  and then eventually coming to accept that it is a good thing</li>
<li>Feeling incredibly unsafe in Aurangabad 2 days after Bal Thackaray&#8217;s death, harassed by a bunch of auto men.</li>
<li>Being told flat out that I&#8217;m not Indian, and having to pull out ID to prove otherwise</li>
<li>Being stranded in Aurangabad, with a bus journey out costing about 50 hours</li>
<li>An airport (Aurangabad) smelling of pure unadultered human shit.</li>
<li>Good things happening</li>
<li>Horrible horrible experience in Agra &#8211; Taj Mahal surrounded by lots and lots of slums with open sewers. Entire place being pimped out for money. The &#8216;two India&#8217;s in sharp contrast again</li>
<li>A 9 year old girl selling pens at traffic signals, speaking to me in a language I could not understand about things that do not need a spoken language to be understood</li>
<li>Surprised to find myself a grown up in Delhi</li>
</ul>

  <p>
    I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;m missing out a few things (intentionally or unintentionally) &#8211; and each of those things would merit a blog post of their own too. Maybe I&#8217;ll write them sometime. Maybe I&#8217;ll write about my (amazing) last year out too.

  <p>I am not a fan of red eye flights. Nobody is</p>

<p>I have one tomorrow. Which brings up the question &#8211; do I stay up, or go to sleep and risk not waking up in time?</p>

<p>I am going to stay up. Let&#8217;s see how that goes :-)</p>

  <p>SumaStorm was my desktop computer. She died a slow, silent and agonizing death over the past few months, which came to light only today. Due to my neglect, she is dead today.</p>

<p>I built SumStorm with my own hands, bought with my own money (thanks to several amazing people on the web) when I was 16 or so. It felt amazing when I first booted it up. It felt amazing when I maxed out all its cores running distcc with my netbook. It felt amazing that I could run Photoshop in a Win7 VM on Ubuntu and not feel a stutter.</p>

<p>It was an amazing machine.</p>

<p>I felt horrible when I realized the extent of the damage the rats had done. This must be how kid feel when the pet dog they grew up with dies. When run over by a tank. Which the kid was driving.</p>

<p>I did not know I could be this attached to a machine. It turned out to be a very emotional few hours.</p>

<p>RIP SumaStorm. I&#8217;m sorry.</p>
