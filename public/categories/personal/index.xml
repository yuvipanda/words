      <description>I&amp;#8217;m writing this post in an attempt to catalog the list of things I own so I can evaluate if I really need them and get rid of them.

      <description>Was a great idea! It just worked (with an OTP cable), and I can now probably find much more uses for this thing than I could before. Yay!
I wonder if I can use this to write code. However, a 7 inch tablet is very poorly suited for that task &amp;#8211; would need at least a 10&amp;#8243; one. But there aren&amp;#8217;t many of those going around these days&amp;#8230;
I&amp;#8217;ll probably use this for random browsing / commenting, and use my Mac for actual programming.</description>

      <description>In Welcome to the Machine there is a line that goes &amp;#8220;provided with toys and scouting for boys&amp;#8221;. I had initially assumed that it was referring to a young guy who is gay and is &amp;#8216;scouting for boys&amp;#8217;.
And then a few days later I realized that it is talking about &amp;#8216;the book&amp;#8216;. That is now doubly funny because of the Boy Scouts&amp;#8217; attitude towards gays</description>

      <description>[Warning: Childish rant ahead]
My natural sleep cycle seems to be one that tends towards the darker times &amp;#8211; sleeping before 3AM feels like an abomination, before midnight unheard of. My best work seems to be done between 2AM and 5AM. My current &amp;lsquo;sleep cycle&amp;rsquo; has me sleeping at about 8AM, and waking up at about 5PM. Plenty of sleep for the day, eh?
It is probably not healthy. I don&amp;rsquo;t look, or feel healthy.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been on the Internet since I was 14. And I don&amp;rsquo;t remember a time when I did not have a computer &amp;#8211; I think I got mine when I was 10. Growing up, writing code has always been a major part of me &amp;#8211; my identity. I&amp;rsquo;ve never quite managed to separate &amp;lsquo;me&amp;rsquo; from &amp;lsquo;my code&amp;rsquo; &amp;#8211; despite mouthing off the soundbite &amp;lsquo;You are not your code!&amp;rsquo; to plenty of people.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m on my longest GitHub Streak this year &amp;#8211; currently 20 days (was previously 18 days). That means I&amp;rsquo;ve had at least one commit (though usually more!) each day for the last 20 days. Sounds much easier than it actually is. Wanting to keep my streak unbroken is also making me write more diverse code &amp;#8211; I think those 20 days feature code in Javascript, Python, Java, PHP and Python. It&amp;rsquo;s also distributed across a lot of projects &amp;#8211; at least 8-9 different ones on last count.</description>

      <description>Ever since the death of Windows Live Writer, I&amp;#8217;ve never managed to find a nice blog editor that I really liked and also worked fine. I had a nice Vim plugin that posted to wordpress for a while, but that seems to have stopped working. The WordPress interface itself is mostly fine, but still a fair bit &amp;#8216;meh&amp;#8217;.
Platen is a markdown based editor that&amp;#8217;s a Chrome Web Store app that looks cool so far.</description>

      <description>Comedy Central has been banned in India for the next ten days. Reasons?
 Whereas, the programme showed a man performing an act of stand_up comedy and mouthing vulgar words accompanied by obscene and suggestive gesture and gyration. During his performance, the man was shown uttering dialogues denigrating women, indecently and crudely referred to sex organs of men-and women and the sing-song rendition by the man sought to pornographically describe .</description>

Growing up to lose respect for people you considered heros is a horrible thing. Friends don&amp;#8217;t let friends fall prey to emotional blackmail.</description>

      <description>Screenshot of Autosuggest working in Tamil on my variant of the Android keyboard. I&amp;#8217;ve been working on this on and off for the last few months (this is also my final year project in college). I&amp;#8217;ve ported all of the jQuery.IME languages to work on the keyboard natively.
Now experimenting with Autosuggest. It only needs an appropriate dictionary now and we&amp;#8217;ll be good to go. Currently I&amp;#8217;m getting Autosuggest working only on Tamil, but the plan is to get it to work for all Indian languages.</description>

 Like if you ask three separate groups of Canadian households how much they&amp;#8217;ll pay to save two thousand, twenty thousand, or two hundred thousand birds from dying in oil ponds, the three groups will respectively state that they&amp;#8217;re willing to pay seventy-eight, eighty-eight, and eighty dollars. No difference, in other words. It&amp;#8217;s called scope insensitivity. Your brain imagines a single bird struggling in an oil pond, and that image creates some amount of emotion that determines your willingness to pay.</description>

They have paste disabled everywhere, by placing onpaste=&amp;#8221;return false&amp;#8221; on all their text elements. I know that this is easily fixable, so let me open inspector by right cli-oh!

Well, no matter &amp;#8211; I can simply use a short cut. Once getting rid of the frustrating onpaste, I found this in the HTML right below it:</description>

      <description>I am too young to remember Microsoft doing anything that could be considered effective &amp;#8216;Embrace, Extend &amp;amp; Extinguish&amp;#8217; (my first browser when using internet at home was Firefox 0.9), and hence could never appreciate the general suspicion with which everything Microsoft was viewed with. Google&amp;#8217;s handling of Reader has remedied that for me, however. I was around to witness all the events that Ed Bott at ZDNet discusses, and hopefully I have learnt my lesson.</description>

      <description>Whatsaapp (and GTalk) has completely replaced SMS for me. The only sore point was that it was not &amp;#8216;Android&amp;#8217;y enough &amp;#8211; looked too much like an iOS port, but it worked well enough (and had enough people in it) that my forays into Hike were never long enough. The latest update fixes the design to be a lot more flat and pleasing to the eyes, and I&amp;#8217;m quite happy to stick to it.</description>

      <description>I&amp;#8217;ve been mostly off Twitter for a while now, interacting with it rarely, and only on my Phone. While I&amp;#8217;ve had a vague feeling of uneasiness ever since they unveiled their now business friendly developer policies, it really hit home when my favorite Android twitter app, Falcon Pro, hit Twitter&amp;#8217;s arbitrary user token limit (and Twitter declined to care). That, plus the Google Reader saga have jolted me out of complacency a bit.</description>

      <description>Reading this blog post from Wesley CrusherWil Wheaton reminded me first of my visit to the beach a few hours before Cyclone Nilam hit landfall (at the Thiruvanmiyur Beach). The fact that I couldn&amp;#8217;t stand in one place (wind) and was constantly being attacked by sand &amp;#8211; it was exhilarating.
The blog post also reminded me of how much I mis-treat my body. I&amp;#8217;m surprised I&amp;#8217;m not bedridden, immovable and with a host of diseases.</description>

      <description>I left Chennai on the 3rd of November. I (will be) leaving Delhi on the 4th of December. That&amp;#8217;s a 31 day trip. It taught me to be optimistic. It taught me in very real terms that the world is a large place, and so is life.
A few highlights:
 Building an app from nothing to workable state in a few days An actual first class train ride in India Running into a bunch of random french people who ended up becoming travel buddies Feeling small, and very temporary being in the ruins of Hampi.</description>

I built SumStorm with my own hands, bought with my own money (thanks to several amazing people on the web) when I was 16 or so. It felt amazing when I first booted it up. It felt amazing when I maxed out all its cores running distcc with my netbook.</description>

      <description>We&amp;#8217;re the Michelangelos of the great age of machine intelligence which is yet to come. We&amp;#8217;re sketching out how it&amp;#8217;s all going to look. We&amp;#8217;re at the forefront of solving incredible problems and creating magical devices. &amp;#8211; DanielBMarkham
 If there&amp;#8217;s a great age of machine intelligence to come, then one in a million of us may be a Michelangelo. The rest of us are house-painters, and the houses we paint are slated for demolition within our own lifetimes.</description>

      <description>Note: These are almost a decade old. Reproduced as close to memory as possible
My first memories of programming aren&amp;#8217;t actually C. They were GW-BASIC, and later on, LOGO. I don&amp;#8217;t remember any of my BASIC &amp;#8211; but I do remember the look on my computer science teacher&amp;#8217;s face in 5th grade when I managed to draw a flower with LOGO when everyone else was doing rectangles and lines. I vividly remember it &amp;#8211; you draw an arc for a certain length, then stop, draw another arc in the reverse direction for the same length &amp;#8211; and you have a petal.</description>

It&amp;#8217;s a bit like HHG2G &amp;#8211; you don&amp;#8217;t read for the storyline (which is jumbled) but for the characters, wit, rationality and humor. Quite a few of those things hit very close to home &amp;#8211; if you are a geek, they would perhaps to you too. Highly reccomended.
Of the many quotable parts of that book, here&amp;#8217;s one little nugget I found:</description>

I know you don&amp;#8217;t want to pre-book travel tickets. You tell yourself that you like the sense of adventure and uncertainity that it gives you. You tell yourself that you need these life expriences.
But I know the truth, ofcourse. You&amp;#8217;re just plain ol&amp;#8217; lazy. Too lazy to book your damn tickets. So, get off your ass and book them now. I&amp;#8217;ll promise you that I&amp;#8217;ll hunt you through time and kill you.</description>

      <description>(Update 3: Manish (@jimanish) was awesome enough to point me to the official stuff from Railway Ministry (pdf here). It starts off by stating the cause for the rules being strict:
 A case relating to lapses in allowing shooting of a feature film (which resulted inburning/damage of some passenger coaches provided to the party causing a huge loss tothe Railways)
 It then notes that it&amp;#8217;s archaic, since you can even shoot from mobile phones, etc.</description>

I&amp;#8217;ve moved across several blogging platforms and urls in the meantime (Blogspot, wordpress and now my own custom engine. I&amp;#8217;ve sadly lost a good portion of my blogs thanks to a domain loss and a server crash. Sigh.
Also, looks like I&amp;#8217;ve been writing code for almost eleven years now!</description>

What I learnt I was the &amp;#8216;tech&amp;#8217; guy &amp;#8211; working with a few people (Karthik, Arun, Madhu, Dinesh, etc) to take care of most things tech.</description>

I&amp;#8217;m still very conscious about riding. I still think before clutching, braking, changing gears, etc. It hasn&amp;#8217;t been internalized in the same way typing on a Keyboard has been &amp;#8211; with enough practice (and accidents!</description>

 recognize that work is something you do to live and isn&amp;#8217;t your whole life
 Let&amp;#8217;s examine this as objectively as we can manage. Lets assume a 40 hour work week where the employer pays for lunch, as the employer should be doing, which results in a real 8 hour day instead of a 9 hour day. Of course a 9 hour day will work even more in favor of my argument.</description>

I&amp;#8217;m certainly significantly wiser at the end of 2009, and that is due more to my state at the beginning of 2009 than at the end :) Good enough
So how did I celebrate? By joining the KPP competition at Kurukshetra. That&amp;#8217;s what I did at around 12 on New Year&amp;#8217;s.</description>

      <description>Document Everything! On paper. Will save you from hell later.  There is never enough time. Start earlier than you think is early enough. Sell people things. Make them want it. Think from their point of view. Prioritize. Delegate. Responsibly. And follow up. Know when to stop. Recognize when something is good enough. Printing takes a long time. Very long timeE. And is boring. People often do not mean what they say.</description>

      <description>Those are my new goals.
I&amp;#8217;ve got a mechanism to track the code accomplishments (will make that public soon), and maybe I&amp;#8217;ll write a widget for HiSlain for the blog post/day accomplishment.
I&amp;#8217;m liking it so far &amp;#8211; 7 hours of code yesterday, along with 2 blog posts. Couldn&amp;#8217;t hit my code target today &amp;#8211; but am hitting my blog target. I should figure out more ways to make this work better.</description>

      <description>He liked her. Very much. He had never felt like that before. The butterflies in his stomach were beating up a storm. He had never believed in love at first sight. Till he saw her.
Her waitress uniform made her look cuter than ever. He knew he had to ask her out. He drummed up enough courage, went to her and said &amp;#8216;Hi&amp;#8217;.
She turned, gave him a cute smile, and replied &amp;#8216;Hello uncle, what can I do for you?</description>

      <description>He was sitting in class. Bored. He looked around. He saw sixty other people, but felt alone. He stood up, shouted &amp;#8216;Why am I here?!? This won&amp;#8217;t do!&amp;#8217; and walked out of the class, leaving everyone confused and weirded out.
He moved out of the campus, and saw sixty thousand other people. He still felt alone. He realized the problem is not the world, but him. Within the next few hours, the problem went away.</description>

      <description>The bus lurched to one side, and fell of the bridge. He felt his skull crack. He realized he had just seconds to live. One hand immobilized, he used the other to find the mobile. Two well practiced presses later, he was at the Compose Message screen. Five seconds later, he had the words &amp;#8216;love ya&amp;#8217; typed out. He hit send, and died peacefully.
Five second later, an error popped up on the screen.</description>

      <description>I&amp;#8217;m Jealous of Freya. I can&amp;#8217;t really seem to figure out why.
Okay, I think I can. Guess it&amp;#8217;s the anonymity. That she can write whatever se wants, without caring a damn.
I can&amp;#8217;t. :(
Go, get jealous.</description>

      <description>I promise her &amp;#8216;the Treat of a Lifetime&amp;#8217;. I cook up a reason realistic enough for her to buy it. I bribe off everyone else to make sure she is alone. And she is.
We walk along the sides of a typical city street. She is talking &amp;#8211; she always is. When has she ever been quiet? Quiet is an adjective one doesn&amp;#8217;t use with the noun &amp;#8216;girl&amp;#8217;. And she&amp;#8217;s no ordinary girl.</description>

      <description>Should I tell her?
I shouldn&amp;#8217;t.
I don&amp;#8217;t even know her. She&amp;#8217;s new in class. So am I. We&amp;#8217;re all new in this class. We are first years, at the first day of college.
I don&amp;#8217;t even know her name! And she obviously doesn&amp;#8217;t know my name. We are, for all intents and purposes, complete strangers in the same class.
What if she takes it seriously? I&amp;#8217;ll probably be branded the classholic flirt of the class, and never be taken seriously ever again.</description>

      <description>He was coding.
He was on a bus, and coding. He had bought himself a cute little black Netbook just so he could open up Vim on a bus and code Python. He is a geek. A young, 18 year old typical geek. As typical as your usual geek.
The bus was quite empty. It was late at night, this was proably the last bus for the day, and except the Driver &amp;amp; Conductor, there were probably 4 people on the bus.</description>

      <description>Geeks Optimize Life. True that. I do optimize the short route from when I get down from my college bus to my home, and me and Sudar did have an argument about optimization when we took the train together one day. My argument was that the distance you are going to walk is constant anyway (you either walk it at the station you are boarding the train, or where you are getting down), so moving to the extreme end of the train is pointless.</description>
