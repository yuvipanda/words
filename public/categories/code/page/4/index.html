  <p>When you&#8217;re proxying requests via nginx, you might assume after reading [the documentation][1] that every header is forwarded, except for the Host and Connection headers.</p>

<p>You&#8217;d also be wrong.</p>

<p>nginx <strong>drops</strong> all headers with an underscore in them.</p>

<p>This is a configurable settings. You can turn it on with a simple</p>

<pre>underscores_in_headers on</pre>

<p>I&#8217;m still baffled as to *why* this is <a href="http://wiki.nginx.org/HttpCoreModule#underscores_in_headers">a configuration parameter</a>. And why it is turned off by default. And why there is no mention of it in the proxy docs.</p>

<p>Thanks to <code>kolbyjack</code> on <code>#nginx</code> for helping me figure this out.</p>

  <p>Note: These are almost a decade old. Reproduced as close to memory as possible</p>

<p>My first memories of programming aren&#8217;t actually C. They were GW-BASIC, and later on, LOGO. I don&#8217;t remember any of my BASIC &#8211; but I do remember the look on my computer science teacher&#8217;s face in 5th grade when I managed to draw a flower with LOGO when everyone else was doing rectangles and lines. I vividly remember it &#8211; you draw an arc for a certain length, then stop, draw another arc in the reverse direction for the same length &#8211; and you have a petal. Then you just offset your next arc by a few degrees, repeat the previous thing, and you have another petal. Do this a few times such that <code>offset-degreese * count = 360</code> and you have a flower. That I could just modify the variables <code>length</code> and <code>offset-degree</code> to draw flowers as big, and with as many petals as you want &#8211; it blew my mind. This was in 5th grade &#8211; and I immediately started pestering my parents to put me in a programming language class outside (I had already gone to classes for _cough_MS Office<em>cough</em> and DOS back then). And the SSI nearby happened to be teaching a reasonably cheap <code>Unix/C/C++</code> class.</p>

<p>The first thing I remember still is someone telling me &#8220;you don&#8217;t need to type out clearscreen(); &#8211; clrscr() would do&#8221;. This was TurboC, and to me, at that point of time, a &#8216;good program&#8217; was one that had a <code>getch()</code> call at the end and a <code>clrscr()</code> in the beginning :)</p>

<p>The <code>Unix/C/C++</code> course &#8211; I don&#8217;t remember any Unix in it. And the C++ was disinteresting to me, because I saw no point in inheriting mammal from animal or car from vehicle. So I went about writing &#8216;C++&#8217;, which was basically C but with <code>cout</code> and <code>cin</code> instead of <code>printf()</code> and <code>scanf()</code> (I wouldn&#8217;t understand classes and how/why they were useful until I read <em>Hardcore Visual Basic 5</em> and saw the ways classes are useful and how much it sucks that VB doesn&#8217;t have them).</p>

<p>I had written a program called <code>DOSTutor</code> then (end of 5th grade, I guess?). It had screens and screens of text that &#8216;taught&#8217; you DOS commands, and then ones that made you type them in and &#8216;checked&#8217; it. Initially I had written it as a long series of <code>printf()</code> and <code>scanf()</code> statements. Suddenly some bulb went on and I realized I could cut my program size by about 90% if I separated code and data, and put the data (screen text and responses) into arrays. The feeling you get when you can reduce code drastically with no reduction in functionality (+ easier to make &#8216;fixes&#8217;) is quite incredible :)</p>

<p>But nobody ever used that program, so I wouldn&#8217;t consider that my first &#8216;program&#8217;. I spent the next year or so messing around with random <code>sound()</code> and <code>nosound()</code> calls producing &#8216;music&#8217; (including a few times when my code hit the <code>sound()</code> call, but crashed before the <code>nosound()</code> call &#8211; thus making the PC Speaker whine constantly, without any apparent way to turn it off. I used to just reset the computer then &#8211; until I learnt what exactly a <code>DOS System Call</code> meant. Then I wrote another small program that just called <code>nosound()</code>). I also remember messing around with BGI Graphics, mostly taking the example programs for <code>graphics.h</code> and modifying them to make somewhat-pretty figures.</p>

<p>My first &#8216;real&#8217; program was an implementation of a variant of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forms_of_cricket#Book_Cricket">Book Cricket</a>. It even had a stored High Scores file. It was my stint at a &#8216;programming center&#8217; (SSI, for those who remember), and I kept it in a Network Drive that I accessed using &#8216;Map Network Drive&#8217;. The amount of fun that was had when I discovered <code>rand()</code> was quite something. It even beeped when you got out!</p>

<p>I lost it all in a server crash. Just do &#8216;Map Network Drive&#8217; once and it was no longer there. I think I came home and cried :(</p>

<p>What was <em>your</em> first program?</p>

<p>Just finished reading &#8216;Javascript &#8211; The Good Parts&#8217;. Here is what I learnt:</p>

<ul>
<li>I knew jack shit about JavaScript. I was able to get along so far simply because I knew jQuery and understood how closures work.</li>
<li>Holy shit that&#8217;s one fucked up language. Quite schizophrenic, saved by almost limitless extensibility/monkey-patchability/watcha-gonna-do-write-a-java-applet-hahaha .</li>
<li>If you&#8217;re going to write Javascript, you&#8217;ll have to subset. Subsetting/augmenting has its own share of problems &#8211; primarily that <code>map</code> in your code might not be the same as <code>map</code> in someone else&#8217;s code, even if they seem to be working on the same &#8216;type&#8217;</li>
<li>jQuery is incredible. I guess it is sort of like a &#8216;Standard Library&#8217; of sorts, atleast on the client side. I&#8217;m sure there exists something similar on the server side as well (underscore.js, perhaps?)</li>
<li>I haven&#8217;t written any sufficiently large Javascript program yet. Need to fix that.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="defensive-programming">Defensive Programming</h3>

<p>When you&#8217;re writing PHP, you program <em>defensively</em>. The language is out to get you. Make one wrong step and it&#8217;ll fuck you over. Never assume anything, make sure you always check the documentation. You can&#8217;t trust the language. It&#8217;s not stupid, it&#8217;s schizophrenic.</p>

<p>I think I should start treating JavaScript also that way.</p>

  <p>I <a href="http://yuvi.in/blog/moving-to-vim-from-emacs.html">moved</a> from emacs to vim a while ago, and have been steadily accumulating a series of plugins in my <code>.vim</code>. They&#8217;re all up in my rather messy <a href="http://github.com/yuvipanda/dotfiles">dotfiles repo</a>. Here&#8217;s a slightly more neatly organized list of the plugins I currently use:</p>

<ol>
<li><a href="http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=3025">command-t</a> &#8211; File opener and buffer switcher. In-fuckin-credibly useful.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1953">vimpress</a> &#8211; What I use to blog since <a href="http://yuvi.in/blog/moving-back-to-wordpress/">moving to wordpress</a>.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=39">matchit</a> &#8211; Lets <code>%</code> work with html tags</li>
<li><s><a href="http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=3695">commentary</a> &#8211; Generic commenting and uncommenting script</s> <a href="http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1218">NERDCommenter</a> has replaced commentary due to being more flexible and having more options.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2975">fugitive</a> &#8211; Incredibly awesome git wrapper for vim. I rarely go to the commandline for git these days</li>
<li><a href="http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=3465">tagbar</a> &#8211; Useful code-exploratory plugin when I&#8217;m looking around a codebase trying to familiarize myself.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1643">supertab</a> &#8211; Buffer completion in insert mode only when I need it.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2423">gist</a> &#8211; Put stuff up in gist to pass it around</li>
<li><a href="http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=559">BufClose</a> &#8211; So I can close a buffer without messing up my splits</li>
<li><a href="http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=3509">extradite</a> &#8211; <code>:Glog</code> replacement that builds on top of fugitive. I don&#8217;t understand why this isn&#8217;t bundled with fugitive</li>
<li><a href="http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2204">TwitVim</a> &#8211; Yes, so I don&#8217;t have to go to the browser (and be consumed by chat/reddit/hn) just to post a tweet.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2572">ack.vim</a> &#8211; Ack integration for vim. Do yourself a favor and use <a href="http://betterthangrep.com">ack</a> instead of grep.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2736">Syntastic</a> &#8211; Automatic syntax checking so that I don&#8217;t miss a semicolon and not know about it</li>
<li><a href="http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1355">php-doc</a> &#8211; Insert boilerplate PHP doc compatible strings in my PHP files whenever I want to. Very PHP specific, need to find something that works across languages. (Note: This plugin has quite some identity crisis. It&#8217;s named PDV but it&#8217;s filename is php-doc. Since php-doc is more descriptive, I&#8217;m using that)</li>
<li><a href="http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2754">delimitMate</a> &#8211; Automatically closes quotes, parens, braces, etc for you. I initially thought this would be super annoying, but in fact it is rather very pleasant.</li>
</ol>

<p><s>I&#8217;m also on the default <code>desert</code> color theme &#8211; haven&#8217;t found anything better. Suggestions welcome &#8211; both for the color scheme and for new/replacement plugins.</s> After trying out <a href="http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1778">wombat</a> and <a href="http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2555">jellybeans</a> color schemes, I have settled on wombat for now.</p>

<p>Suggestions for more plugins still welcome :)</p>

<p><s>This is the list as of 24 Aug 2011.</s> <s>Updated as of September 2 2011 (added 10, 11, 12 since last update).</s> <s>Updated as of September 5 2011 (changed 4, added colorscheme change).</s> Updated as of September 12 2011 (added 13, 14, 15). I am moving quite fast, am I not? Will keep this post updated as and when things change.</p>

  <p>I was debugging an issue <a href="http://interviewstreet.com">at work</a> today where a (generated) file refused to download in Chrome, but the same URL worked just fine with wget. I remember reading in the <a href="http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec2.html#sec2.2">HTTP Spec</a> that HTTP headers can only be lower ASCII, so when wget mangled the output file&#8217;s name, the problem was obvious &#8211; the file name contained a character that wasn&#8217;t in lower ASCII (an accented A). Chrome had borked on encountering it, while wget soldiered on. Using <code>iconv</code> to strip non-ASCII characters in the file name on the server side fixed the issue.</p>

<p>Moral of the story? Read the RFCs! The <a href="http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616.html">HTTP one</a>, in particular, is remarkably readable and you <em>should</em> read it if you&#8217;re doing non-trivial Web Development.</p>

<p>P.S: If I had had time, I&#8217;d have went around testing this behavior in several user agents and documenting their behavior (and possibly submitting bug reports) &#8211; but <insert-excuse-here>.</p>

  <p>From <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2870176">HN</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>From my experience, the largest hurdle first time programmers have is being able to execute programs in their head. <strong><em>It takes a cognitive leap to go from the source code in front of them, and what happens at runtime</em>.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>(emphasis mine)</em></p>

<p>I believe that if you have made that <em>cognitive leap</em>, you can call yourself a programmer. It means you&#8217;ve entered into the <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2006/07/separating-programming-sheep-from-non-programming-goats.html">second hump</a> &#8211; you are a programmer. One of us. Welcome :)</p>

<p>This is also the reason why solving programming challenges at places like <a href="http://interviewstreet.com/recruit/challenges">InterviewStreet Challenges</a>, <a href="http://codechef.com">CodeChef</a>, <a href="http://topcoder.com">TopCoder</a>, <a href="http://spoj.pl">SPOJ</a>, etc also increase your general programming skills &#8211; they require that you continuously run code in the interpreter in your head. Helps you train your <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procedural_memory">procedural memory</a>. Same reason why learning different language paradigms (OOP, Purely Functional, Procedural, etc) makes you a better programmer.</p>

<p>Reminds me that I have four more chapters in SICP to finish and Clojure to learn :)</p>

  <p>4Chan isn&#8217;t exactly what you&#8217;d associate with &#8216;shit, that&#8217;s a cool piece of code!&#8217;, but look <a href="http://dis.4chan.org/read/prog/1295544154">what I found</a>!</p>

<p>(<a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2657277">via HN</a>)</p>

<p>Nice hack. And it <strong>is</strong> <code>O(N)</code> in bitsize of largest number (Ignoring all the overhead of forking new processes, the problem with the race conditions(Sort 0 and 0.1? How about 0.01 and 0.011?), processor contention, etc,.) They basically delegated the sorting to the process scheduler, treating it as a sort of priority queue.</p>

<p>Sometimes you just see a hack so out of the box that it makes you say &#8216;woah!&#8217; and let your mouth hang open there for a while. One such time this :)</p>

  <p>No, I&#8217;m <em>not</em> going to blow your mind by telling you I&#8217;m going to do the SICP exercises in BrainFuck :)</p>

<p>I just wrote <a href="https://gist.github.com/969657">my first brainfuck program</a>. Might as well be my last, but not sure. Tape-based turing-ish programing seems fun, so maybe I&#8217;ll try that again with something more expressive than brainfuck (or maybe that is pointless?)</p>

<p>And I&#8217;m doing the SICP Exercises. In <a href="http://groups.csail.mit.edu/mac/projects/scheme/">MIT-Scheme</a>. I&#8217;ve put them <a href="https://github.com/yuvipanda/sicp-exercises">up on GitHub</a>. I&#8217;m doing this with the <a href="http://fpug-c.posterous.com/">FPUG-C</a> SICP Study Group, so hope I&#8217;m able to complete it all this time :) Big props to <a href="http://www.openbala.com/">Balaji</a> for organizing it, and letting us get away with the free coke and coffee!</p>

  <p>My <code>GStreamer 101</code> presentation at <a href="http://gnome.asia">GNOME.asia</a> was <em>very</em> wel received. I was quite happy with the way it turned out. Thanks to <a href="http://arunraghavan.net/">Ford_Prefect</a> and <a href="http://abharath.wordpress.com/">Bharath Acharya</a> for pulling me in :)</p>

<p>My very minimal slides are <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/yuvipanda/gstreamer-101">here</a>. You can reuse them if you want to.</p>

<p>Sadly, missed the week long hackfest :( Next time!</p>

<p><em>I&#8217;ve started keeping devlogs, recording everyday &#8216;productive&#8217; activity I do everyday. Publicly shaming myself into doing something productive every day. Just records for this month, next month on should provide time spent as well. There&#8217;s an entry for every day when I&#8217;ve touched a computer. I&#8217;ll be continuously refining this format, so feedback welcome</em></p>

<h3 id="27-jan">27 Jan</h3>

<p>More of nothing productive. 32HourStartup is eating into my dev time.</p>

<h3 id="26-jan">26 Jan</h3>

<p>Nothing productive. Ugh. 32hourstartup website.</p>

<h3 id="25-jan">25 Jan</h3>

<p>Nothing productive. 32hourstartup website finally properly done.</p>

<h3 id="24-jan">24 Jan</h3>

<p>PiTiVi can now record audio into proper temp files, and insert them into the sources list when done. Also have a neat, complicated looking (:() VUMeter integrated.</p>

<p>Worked on the 32hourstartup website. Deployment is a bitch.</p>

<p>Couldn&#8217;t sleep. Woke up, fixed site. Fucking slow.</p>

<h3 id="23-jan">23 Jan</h3>

<p>Not much code. Worked on 32 Hour Startup website. Read more clojure books.</p>

<h3 id="22-jan">22 Jan</h3>

<p>Attended Geekweekend. Was fun. I&#8217;m now gonna learn myself some clojure. Setup a clojure dev environment. Trying to kill my JVM Biases.</p>

<h3 id="21-jan">21 Jan</h3>

<p>Read more PiTiVi code. Refactored the audiorecord bits off. Registered and put up a landing page on 32hourstartup.com</p>

<h3 id="20-jan">20 Jan</h3>

<p>Did nothing today. Read parts of PiTiVi code. Built up my ohloh profile a bit more. That is it. Sad</p>

<h3 id="19-jan">19 Jan</h3>

<h4 id="busroutes-in-wiki">Busroutes.in wiki</h4>

<p>Nothing major got done. Unable to figure out easy way to start out on chennai (the center and zoom properties don&#8217;t seem to work &#8211; maybe parser caching?). Need to spend more time on this</p>

<h4 id="pitivi">PiTiVi</h4>

<p>Finally settled on a UI that both me and @nekohayo liked (&#8216;inspired&#8217; in no small way by iMovie :P). Should start working on the actual implementation now. Sent first email to the FSF folks with some semblance of &#8216;work done&#8217;. Feels good.</p>

<h4 id="misc-sysadmin-stuff">Misc Sysadmin Stuff</h4>

<p>Setup server for Mohan.</p>

<h3 id="18-jan">18 Jan</h3>

<h4 id="busroutes-in-wiki-1">Busroutes.in Wiki</h4>

<p>Got Semantic Forms to work with Map input. Pulled in @kidbees (Bala) who did most of the Train routes entry. Templatized &#8216;Type&#8217; for host. Need to find easier way to geocode.</p>

<h4 id="pitivi-1">PiTiVi</h4>

<p>Preliminary UI work/discussion with the PiTiVi guys. The dialog box approach didn&#8217;t quite work out, so we&#8217;re now moving to something more elegant and simplistic. It&#8217;s fun working with a responsive community (@nekohayo)</p>

<h3 id="12-17-jan">12-17 Jan</h3>

<h4 id="busroutes-in-wiki-2">Busroutes.in Wiki</h4>

<p><a href="http://wiki.busroutes.in">http://wiki.busroutes.in</a> is up and running, thanks to AWS Free and @logic&#8217;s credit card. Semantic Mediawiki and a few extensions on. Getting to work figuring out all the templates and the extensions that turn SMW into something rather close to a programming language (It has conditionals! And templates can really be thought of as retarded functions). Started adding MRTS data &#8211; aim to complete Chennai Suburban Rails too fully and expose that data.</p>

<h4 id="tamilbeat-com-script">Tamilbeat.com Script</h4>

<p>Simple python script that scraped Tamilbeat.com, located all songs for all movies and spat out a shell script that used wget to download them into properly organized folders. The script also used <code>eyeD3</code> to set artist information on the songs. The script produced was incredibly dirty (no error checking, <strong>HUGE</strong> <em>fuck you</em> to &#8216;seperation of code and data&#8217;) &#8211; but worked wonderfully. Too wonderfully infact &#8211; I quickly used up 20G of my 25G allowance per month of usage, and it shows no sign of quitting. Will re run once I cross 25G.</p>

<p>The template output method was neat (template contained in .py file as triple quoted string, jinja2 template). Should rework it to seperate code and data.</p>

<h4 id="cheese">Cheese</h4>

<p>Planning on helping out with the port to gtk3. Spent good few hours on 17th setting up a gtk3 env (no jhbuild, uses &#8211;prefix and a custom activate script). Maybe I should try and learn how to use jhbuild &#8211; but my experience (and that of others in general) seems to be one of pain. Maybe next time I need to setup something custom.</p>

<h4 id="work-that-needed-to-be-done-but-not-done">Work that needed to be done, but not done</h4>

<p>PiTiVi. I&#8217;ll give it more love next week.</p>

<p>The Backup Thingy. I <em>do</em> need to do this. But when?</p>

<p>Personal Domains. Ugh.</p>

<h4 id="misc-sysadmin-stuff-1">Misc. Sysadmin stuff</h4>

<ul>
<li>Setup SSN&#8217;s Lakshya website on my server (webfaction). I personally found <a href="http://ssnlakshya.cloud10.in">http://ssnlakshya.cloud10.in</a> hilarious ;)</li>
<li>Setup PHP for Sriram on pirayalpha. Need to setup wsgi for him. Also gave him ownership of his nginx conf file, so he can actually do edits &#8211; but I&#8217;ve to be around to restart it. Proved a good decision, as he accidentally left out a } the first time he edited anything and bought the server to a halt. He&#8217;s incredibly remarkable for a 12 year old.</li>
<li>Tried upgrading my system to Natty. Botched. Main system getting more and more fucked by the day. Fresh install of Maverick, or is it finally time to move to Debian on my main system too?</li>
</ul>
