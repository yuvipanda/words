<p><em>[Note: I&#8217;ve a rather large backlog of blog posts to do, will push them out as soon as I can]</em></p>

<p>Saturday (22 Jan 2011) was spent at <a href="http://www.geekweekend.in/index.html">Geekweekend</a>, organized at <a href="http://www.thoughtworks.com/other-offices">Thougtworks Chennai</a>. The event had awesomeness written all over it, even before it started &#8211; how can <em>any</em> event where you register through a (rather limited, but still) command line interface on a website be not good? :D</p>

<p>I was late as usual (damn living so far away from everywhere) &#8211; and found my way walking through the underbelly of the Kathipara junction thanks to <a href="http://maps.google.co.in">Google Maps&#8217; Walking Directions</a> :P</p>

<h2 id="clojure">Clojure</h2>

<p>Missed the first session. Turned up for the clojure session &#8211; it was good. I&#8217;ve been meaning to learn one of the OMGPARANTHESES langueages, and from the tooling/library support &#8211; clojure seems to be the way to go. Spent time during the talk setting up my machine to do clojure dev (took forever to setup &#8211; it is a netbook, afterall). Wanted to build something small before the end of the event (like a URL Shortener!) but too late for that.</p>

<p>I do plan on writing something with clojure in the short term though. Looking for ideas.</p>

<h2 id="lunch">Lunch</h2>

<p>Lunch. Met the usual group of geeks around. Fun, as usual :D Lunch was excellent. Me and <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/sup3rkiddo">Superkiddo</a> continued the tradition of stealing sweets from <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/justjkk">Kishore</a>&#8216;s plate :D</p>

<h2 id="monads">Monads</h2>

<p>Then came the session on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monad_(functional_programming)">Monads</a>. I still don&#8217;t understand them. But that&#8217;s okay &#8211; the discussion was rather intellectually stimulating. It also reminded me that my mathematical/theoretical-cs foundation is incredibly weak (by geek standards) and needs updating/pushing up. Should start on <a href="http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/">SICP</a> (<em>again</em>).</p>

<h2 id="purely-functional-languages-on-the-fringe">Purely Functional Languages on the fringe</h2>

<p>The discussions were the most fun, productive part of the day, IMO. Most people who weren&#8217;t fully interested had already left &#8211; so the self-selected crowd was rather intense. Nobody there was actually using any purely functional language in production &#8211; which was expected. My opinion is that <em>purely</em> functional languages will always be on the fringe &#8211; as they should be. But features from them will trickle in slowly into mainstream, <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/avg.html">blub</a> programming languages (even PHP <a href="http://php.net/manual/en/functions.anonymous.php">has lambdas</a> now!). Learning to think in a functional way will expand your mind, and make you a better programmer &#8211; even if you&#8217;re not programming in a purely functional language.</p>

<h2 id="my-irrational-hate-for-java">My Irrational Hate for Java</h2>

<p>I&#8217;m not sure from where &#8212; perhaps the fucked up Java GUI apps, or my early stage semicolon/case-sensitivity hate (hey, I was 14, what do you expect!) or the fact that Java the language is way too verbose &#8212; I&#8217;ve had an irrational <strong>hate</strong> of all things Java/JVM. But that&#8217;s just that &#8211; irrational. So I&#8217;m taking a concerted effort to learn myself some JVM &#8211; hence clojure. I still don&#8217;t like Java the language (C# FTW!) &#8211; but the tools and libraries around JVM seem to be pretty good. Let&#8217;s see how this experiment at de-biasing turns out!</p>

<h2 id="functional-programming-users-group">Functional Programming Users group</h2>

<p>The idea of a Functional Language Users group was floated around. Waiting for it to turn up!</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: <a href="http://fpug-c.posterous.com/#!/">Here you go</a>. Join up and keep posting. I&#8217;m not sure how the idea of posterous groups will work out though.</p>

<h2 id="thoughtworks-8216-crowd-8217">Thoughtworks &#8216;crowd&#8217;</h2>

<p>I&#8217;ve generally found that events organized at Thoughworks/by Thoughtworkers have higher average audience quality than most other events. Thanks for putting together events guys :)</p>

  <p>This semester, one of our so called <em>electives</em> (despite the fact that we have no real choice in them) is Numerical Methods. I don&#8217;t quite like the actual way the subject is taught &#8211; mind numbing, error prone calculations with a calculator. However, the methods are pretty awesome.</p>

<p>The staff explained <a href="https://gist.github.com/753872">Gauss Seidel</a> yesterday, and it seemed a straightforward recursive solution to me. So in the break, I cooked up a small python <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gauss%E2%80%93Seidel_method">script</a> that gave me all the intermediate answers as well &#8211; so for any <em>assignments</em> I could just run them through this and copy it to paper.</p>

<p>What happened after that was more interesting. The staff made an offhand remark that she hates the subject, since it involves so much mindnumbingly repetitive calculative work, and not something fun like probability theory. I picked it up, and we had an interesting conversation that ended up with me showing her a 3-function version of the above code and explaining to her how I got this. She was incredibly interested &#8211; and asked me how to explain each line properly.</p>

<p>Was a lot of fun. Sad that this is the first time in 3 years that I&#8217;ve had someone who is actually interested in what they&#8217;re teaching, rather than treating it as just a normal 9-5 job not much different from herding sheep. What exactly can we do to change this?</p>

  <p>I moved to Vim from Emacs a while back. I realized I was not using emacs to its fullest extent &#8211; I was using it as &#8216;just a text editor&#8217;, and alt-tabbing to <code>gnome-terminal</code> for most of my work. I was using one tool per job anyway, so why not go all the way and use a <a href="http://www.vim.org/">text editor</a> for a text editor instead of <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/">yet another operating system</a> :P</p>

<p>Also, and perhaps more importantly &#8211; on my rather small <a href="http://yuvi.in/blog/samsung-n210-review.html">Netbook</a>, pressing combos felt awkward to me (I know it shouldn&#8217;t have, but it did). Much better (atleast so far) with vim than Emacs. Since most of my coding these days seems to be done on this small and underpowered machine, and my wrists were hurting anyway, I switched.</p>

<p>Muscle memory is still set to emacs (hit <code>C-k</code> several times when it should&#8217;ve been <code>d$</code>), but I guess I&#8217;ll eventually get back to being fast enough in vim :)</p>

<p>Last time I was on vim, I was just getting used to Linux, and switched to emacs a few months after. I wonder if I&#8217;ll switch again in the future.</p>

<p>TL;DR: Moved from Emacs to Vim &#8216;coz I felt like it.</p>

  <p>&#8220;Why does Cheese have a maximum photo count of 100 in burst mode?&#8221; questions have popped up quite a few times on the cheese list. It is just a teeny, tiny bug &#8211; fixed in master.</p>

<p>The work around is simple:</p>

<p><strong>Till Cheese 2.32</strong></p>

<p>Raise it to whatever value you want in <code>line 8</code> of <code>/usr/share/cheese/cheese-prefs.ui</code>.</p>

<p><em>(If you don&#8217;t know what version you are running, check <code>Help -&gt; About</code>)</em></p>

<p>(Fix is just raising the limit from 100 to something that most people will likely not hit. If they do hit it &#8211; well, <code>line 40 on /usr/share/cheese/cheese-prefs.ui</code> :D)</p>

  <p>I posted a while back that I <a href="http://yuvi.in/blog/running-archlinux.html">moved</a> to Arch (from Ubuntu) on my Netbook. That was almost two months back. My Arch experiment, sadly, didn&#8217;t work out for long. I moved back to Ubuntu within a couple of week&#8217;s time. Why?</p>

<ol>
<li>Lack of binary packages. I had to build quite a few packages from source because there were no binary packages available. The tilting point was when I figured there were no binary packges for mit-scheme! Ofcourse, I could&#8217;ve just used AUR and built them from source, but&#8230;</li>
<li>Building from source on my Netbook sucks. ATOM + Slow Hard Drive -&gt; I&#8217;m nuts waiting for stuff to compile. The AUR is basically useless to me.</li>
</ol>

<p>Hello Ubuntu! (I also hate Unity &#8216;coz it takes up precious screen space &#8211; might move to something else soon)</p>

<p>TL;DR: Arch doesn&#8217;t have enough binary packages and building on a netbook sucks</p>

  <p>I&#8217;m blogging from Arch Linux :D</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve been meaning to setup Arch on <a href="http://yuvi.in/blog/samsung-n210-review.html">my netbook</a> for a while, after hearing a lot of people rave about how awesome <code>pacman</code> is and how fast their system is. I didn&#8217;t want to spend time on moving to a new distro during my GSoC, so I kept putting it off. Yesterday Ubuntu borked on my netbook for some weird reason (I suspect it was my friend Rathna sitting on it, but might have been because I was thinking of moving to Vim too) &#8211; and I took the opportunity to install Arch. After some messing around, and some help from #archlinux, I was able to get myself a commandline that also connected to the Internet via wifi. Yay!</p>

<p>I tried out <a href="http://lxde.org/">LXDE</a> first, instead of my usual <a href="http://www.gnome.org/">GNOME</a> &#8211; and found that it was incredibly unpolished (compared to GNOME). So after a bit of a struggle (AND READING DOCS! (and yes, my problem was dbus)), I got a minimal (very application-less) GNOME up and running. And yes, it is way faster. And yes, the packages are newer (and shinier!). And #archlinux was helpful :)</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve had to (understand and) edit a fair amount of config files to get myself a working system. It&#8217;s been a fun and informative journey &#8211; and I expect it will continue to be. My entire Linux experience so far has been with Ubuntu (hell, even the server I administer runs Ubuntu!), so coming to this world of required-and-encouraged config file editing is doing me good :)</p>

<p>I&#8217;m enjoying it :) If you&#8217;re a geek who loves fast text scrolling on an LCD (and you also have the time), you too would.</p>

  <p>Google Summer of Code ended a while back. Me (and most on #gsoc) agreed on one thing &#8211; WHERE DID THOSE 3 MONTHS GO? Amazing time it was &#8211; thanks to <a href="http://www.dgsiegel.net/">_ke</a> (Who is frolicking somewhere in Thailand right now), <a href="http://blogs.gnome.org/fargiolas/">fargiolas</a> and the rest of the GNOME guys (#clutter, #gstreamer and #gtk+ yay!) for making it awesome. #hackers-india was a great venting place too :)</p>

<p><a href="http://projects.gnome.org/cheese/">Cheese</a>&#8216;s <a href="http://git.gnome.org/browse/cheese">master</a> needs quite a bit of work before it can be included in <a href="http://live.gnome.org/ThreePointZero">GNOME 3.0</a> &#8211; and I plan on doing most of that. It&#8217;s fun &#8211; demoing it at college is a huge hit. Looks like eventually, my <a href="http://yuvi.in/blog/gsoc-2010-proposal.html">original goal</a> for Cheese might be met ;)</p>

<p>Right now, I&#8217;m decompressing, and basically not doing anything at all &#8211; except getting a bike, and sorting out some personal issues. Should be back coding (and blogging) soon. Have a huge post on GSoC experience coming up.</p>

  </header>
  <p>If you had read my <a href="http://yuvi.in/blog/gsoc-2010-proposal.html">Cheese GSoC proposal</a>, it would&#8217;ve stressed on one major point &#8211; make Cheese sexy.</p>

<p>Two days ago, one of my classmates spent 5 minutes on the bus using Cheese and trying out different effects (and poses!). Today, my brother spent 20 minutes trying to get the perfect combination of style and vagueness for his Facebook profile picture &#8211; using Cheese. He then asked me to create an account for him in Ubuntu (he was an exclusively Win7 user till then) before leaving.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m still not where I want to be (the girls haven&#8217;t gone gaga over it&#8230;yet!), but I know very well that I am on the right path.</p>

<p>And a major milestone in that path is the release of Cheese 2.31.1. The &#8216;release&#8217; means that the code is now stable enough to be actually shown off. The major features (rewrite in Vala, use Clutter, user defined Effects and most importantly, Live Previews) are in working condition. We are no longer walking through a minefield of segfaults. You can build it and show it off. When something breaks and <a href="http://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/sources/cheese/2.31/">you tell us</a>, we&#8217;ll most probably not reply with &#8216;yeah, we know that. We&#8217;ll fix it when we get to it&#8217;. The road to Cheese 3.0 has begun.</p>

<p>So, what&#8217;s all in this release?</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Rewrite of the UI code. We removed the entire old src/ folder, and rewrote everything from scratch. Using <a href="http://live.gnome.org/Vala">Vala</a>. Why? Because ~7000 lines of C code is now ~1500 lines of Vala code. And the Vala code has more features (Live preview, for one!). The Vala compiler is pretty mature &#8211; only one &#8216;real&#8217; bug so far (rest have been mostly binding bugs, fixed with single line of code changes). And #vala has been incredibly helpful too! And we are re-using most of the &#8216;backend&#8217; code (Camera detection, pipeline linking, etc) &#8211; it is still in C, and writing Vala bindings was incredibly simple.</p></li>

<li><p>Move from Gtk to Clutter for display. Means I can do stuff like overlay semi-transparent text on top of the effects. Or have animated page transitions. Or (in the future), use OpenGL effects without having to do an extra to-fro copy from memory. Have drop shadows for everything. Make the effects tilt and rotate around when hovered over. Etc, etc, etc. Clutter is the major contributor to the &#8216;sexy&#8217; part.</p></li>

<li><p>User created effects. Effects are no longer hardcoded. A simple 4 line text file and enthusiasm for reading documentation is all that is required to create your own effect. The effects are based on GStreamer, and are very flexible &#8211; you can create something as simple as monochrome + hue, or something as complex as face detection + extra limb addition to specific people :P</p></li>

<li><p>Live Streaming &#8211; biggie. All effects are arranged in grids of 3&#215;3 in multiple pages that you can swipe through. Simply clicking one will activate it pretty much instantaneously. No more &#8216;select effect, apply, no-it-sucks, let&#8217;s go back and do it again&#8217; games :)</p></li>
</ol>

<p><a href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/8768784/cheese-midterm.ogv"><img src="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/8768784/cheese-midterm.png" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>I made a <a href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/8768784/cheese-midterm.ogv">quick screencast</a> to show the new Live preview stuff to those of you too lazy to actually get the source and compile. And the subject is a pink+green teddy bear sitting on my white netbook. (And the weird stuff that turns up after I exit fullscreen is a bug in <a href="http://recordmydesktop.sourceforge.net/about.php">RecordMyDesktop</a> &#8211; and is an incentive for you to actually <a href="http://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/sources/cheese/2.31/">get the source</a> and check it out :P)</p>

<p>These are the four <em>major</em> features that are new. All the other parts of previous Cheese UI have also been implemented (preferences, thumbnail viewer, fullscreen, wide mode, device detection, etc.)</p>

<p>As for the next release &#8211; keep looking out for it, it will land soon! It will primarily be a bug fix and code cleanup release &#8211; fixing crashes, UI inconsistencies and making sure everything works as intended.</p>

<p>A lot of late night hackery (mostly because my college takes up 10 hours of &#8216;regular&#8217; time) has gone into this release &#8211; so check it out <a href="http://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/sources/cheese/2.31/">here</a> and tell us what you think. Especially about the parts that suck. Especially useful would be if you can get someone non-technical to sit in front of Cheese, observe where all they fail (and succeed) and then report your observations back to us.</p>

<p>I would give an arm, a leg, an eye and other assorted body parts if I could find such a room. And live there.</p>
