  <p>Richard Gabriel&#8217;s <a href="http://www.jwz.org/doc/worse-is-better.html">Worse is Better</a> (falsly attributed to <a href="http://www.jwz.org">jwz</a> by many), is a piece on how LISP lost out to C, despite being &#8216;better&#8217;.</p>

<p>Jim Waldo&#8217;s <a href="http://www.artima.com/weblogs/viewpost.jsp?thread=24807">Worse is Worse</a> notes, quite accurately, that what us geeks consider &#8216;better&#8217; might not what is, in the context of the universe at large, &#8216;better&#8217;. To quote,</p>

<blockquote>
<p>[&#8230;] what we see is that better is a complicated notion, and can depend on a variety of different metrics. It may be disappointing to find out that what we geeks think of as better may not be what our customers think is better. But finding this out shouldn&#8217;t surprise us too much.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There is also explanations on how on many of the examples used to justify worse as being &#8216;better&#8217;, the wrong criteria was being used.</p>

<p>The original piece has been used to justify people producing shoddy, shitty work quite frequently. Waldo agrees:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>My problem with the slogan is that it has become a catch phrase for those who either haven&#8217;t read the original article, or have read it and either have forgotten what it really talked about or never understood it in the first place. As a catch phrase, it is often used to justify shoddy design, or following the crowd rather than doing what is right, or as short-hand for the real claim that our customers are too stupid to either appreciate or deserve high quality products. Why spend the time doing things right, this line of reasoning goes, when we all know that worse is better. You are far better off giving the customer something that you know is less than what you could produce, because they (those simple customers) will think that it is better.</p>

<p>The end result of this thinking is sloppy products that don&#8217;t work, are hard to use, or are unreliable (or all of the above). We try to convince our customers that this is the way software has to be, and then turn around and convince ourselves that they won&#8217;t pay for anything better. But we short-change our customers, and we cheapen our craft, when we put up with this sort of thinking. When the original article was produced, I don&#8217;t think that this is what the author had in mind; even if it was, it is time for us to reject the simple-minded interpretation of the slogan, and start putting out software that really is better (on the dimension of goodness that our customers have, not necessarily our own).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#8217;ve sadly had to personally witness this at a few places. When &#8216;shit work&#8217; becomes acceptable, it very soon becomes the norm. Eventually people consider that not just the norm, but <em>something to aspire to</em> &#8211; as if producing something that is actually shit is, somehow, <em>better</em> than producing something actually better. If you notice that happening to yourself / your project, please step back a bit, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Whacking_with_a_wet_trout">trout</a> yourself, and do the right thing.</p>

<p>THIS IS SO COOL!</p>

<p>I am now editing this blog post from my new Nexus 7.</p>

<p>THIS IS SO COOL!</p>

<p>I am a few years behind the curve on this. Last year was spent slogging my ass out at a wonderful startup and travelling to a lot of places meeting and working with some wonderful people. Left very little time for staying on the bleeding edge.</p>

<p>Changing that fast &#8211; trying to produce useful stuff while also staying close to the bleeding edge. Fun times ahead :-)</p>

  <p>I&#8217;ve gotten rid of my Vim repo from GitHub, and switched to using <a href="https://github.com/gmarik/vundle">Vundle</a> + DropBox to keep my vim environment safely backed up.</p>

<p>You can find my <a href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/8768784/vimrc">.vimrc</a> file here. With just this and Vundle setup, I find it much easier to port my settings elsewhere instead of using git.</p>

<p>Hat tip to <a href="http://www.arunmozhi.in/">tecoholic</a> for pushing me to switch to Vundle :)</p>

  <p>When you&#8217;re proxying requests via nginx, you might assume after reading [the documentation][1] that every header is forwarded, except for the Host and Connection headers.</p>

<p>You&#8217;d also be wrong.</p>

<p>nginx <strong>drops</strong> all headers with an underscore in them.</p>

<p>This is a configurable settings. You can turn it on with a simple</p>

<pre>underscores_in_headers on</pre>

<p>I&#8217;m still baffled as to *why* this is <a href="http://wiki.nginx.org/HttpCoreModule#underscores_in_headers">a configuration parameter</a>. And why it is turned off by default. And why there is no mention of it in the proxy docs.</p>

<p>Thanks to <code>kolbyjack</code> on <code>#nginx</code> for helping me figure this out.</p>

  <p>Note: These are almost a decade old. Reproduced as close to memory as possible</p>

<p>My first memories of programming aren&#8217;t actually C. They were GW-BASIC, and later on, LOGO. I don&#8217;t remember any of my BASIC &#8211; but I do remember the look on my computer science teacher&#8217;s face in 5th grade when I managed to draw a flower with LOGO when everyone else was doing rectangles and lines. I vividly remember it &#8211; you draw an arc for a certain length, then stop, draw another arc in the reverse direction for the same length &#8211; and you have a petal. Then you just offset your next arc by a few degrees, repeat the previous thing, and you have another petal. Do this a few times such that <code>offset-degreese * count = 360</code> and you have a flower. That I could just modify the variables <code>length</code> and <code>offset-degree</code> to draw flowers as big, and with as many petals as you want &#8211; it blew my mind. This was in 5th grade &#8211; and I immediately started pestering my parents to put me in a programming language class outside (I had already gone to classes for _cough_MS Office<em>cough</em> and DOS back then). And the SSI nearby happened to be teaching a reasonably cheap <code>Unix/C/C++</code> class.</p>

<p>The first thing I remember still is someone telling me &#8220;you don&#8217;t need to type out clearscreen(); &#8211; clrscr() would do&#8221;. This was TurboC, and to me, at that point of time, a &#8216;good program&#8217; was one that had a <code>getch()</code> call at the end and a <code>clrscr()</code> in the beginning :)</p>

<p>The <code>Unix/C/C++</code> course &#8211; I don&#8217;t remember any Unix in it. And the C++ was disinteresting to me, because I saw no point in inheriting mammal from animal or car from vehicle. So I went about writing &#8216;C++&#8217;, which was basically C but with <code>cout</code> and <code>cin</code> instead of <code>printf()</code> and <code>scanf()</code> (I wouldn&#8217;t understand classes and how/why they were useful until I read <em>Hardcore Visual Basic 5</em> and saw the ways classes are useful and how much it sucks that VB doesn&#8217;t have them).</p>

<p>I had written a program called <code>DOSTutor</code> then (end of 5th grade, I guess?). It had screens and screens of text that &#8216;taught&#8217; you DOS commands, and then ones that made you type them in and &#8216;checked&#8217; it. Initially I had written it as a long series of <code>printf()</code> and <code>scanf()</code> statements. Suddenly some bulb went on and I realized I could cut my program size by about 90% if I separated code and data, and put the data (screen text and responses) into arrays. The feeling you get when you can reduce code drastically with no reduction in functionality (+ easier to make &#8216;fixes&#8217;) is quite incredible :)</p>

<p>But nobody ever used that program, so I wouldn&#8217;t consider that my first &#8216;program&#8217;. I spent the next year or so messing around with random <code>sound()</code> and <code>nosound()</code> calls producing &#8216;music&#8217; (including a few times when my code hit the <code>sound()</code> call, but crashed before the <code>nosound()</code> call &#8211; thus making the PC Speaker whine constantly, without any apparent way to turn it off. I used to just reset the computer then &#8211; until I learnt what exactly a <code>DOS System Call</code> meant. Then I wrote another small program that just called <code>nosound()</code>). I also remember messing around with BGI Graphics, mostly taking the example programs for <code>graphics.h</code> and modifying them to make somewhat-pretty figures.</p>

<p>My first &#8216;real&#8217; program was an implementation of a variant of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forms_of_cricket#Book_Cricket">Book Cricket</a>. It even had a stored High Scores file. It was my stint at a &#8216;programming center&#8217; (SSI, for those who remember), and I kept it in a Network Drive that I accessed using &#8216;Map Network Drive&#8217;. The amount of fun that was had when I discovered <code>rand()</code> was quite something. It even beeped when you got out!</p>

<p>I lost it all in a server crash. Just do &#8216;Map Network Drive&#8217; once and it was no longer there. I think I came home and cried :(</p>

<p>What was <em>your</em> first program?</p>

  </header>
  

<p>Just finished reading &#8216;Javascript &#8211; The Good Parts&#8217;. Here is what I learnt:</p>

<ul>
<li>I knew jack shit about JavaScript. I was able to get along so far simply because I knew jQuery and understood how closures work.</li>
<li>Holy shit that&#8217;s one fucked up language. Quite schizophrenic, saved by almost limitless extensibility/monkey-patchability/watcha-gonna-do-write-a-java-applet-hahaha .</li>
<li>If you&#8217;re going to write Javascript, you&#8217;ll have to subset. Subsetting/augmenting has its own share of problems &#8211; primarily that <code>map</code> in your code might not be the same as <code>map</code> in someone else&#8217;s code, even if they seem to be working on the same &#8216;type&#8217;</li>
<li>jQuery is incredible. I guess it is sort of like a &#8216;Standard Library&#8217; of sorts, atleast on the client side. I&#8217;m sure there exists something similar on the server side as well (underscore.js, perhaps?)</li>
<li>I haven&#8217;t written any sufficiently large Javascript program yet. Need to fix that.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="defensive-programming">Defensive Programming</h3>

<p>When you&#8217;re writing PHP, you program <em>defensively</em>. The language is out to get you. Make one wrong step and it&#8217;ll fuck you over. Never assume anything, make sure you always check the documentation. You can&#8217;t trust the language. It&#8217;s not stupid, it&#8217;s schizophrenic.</p>

<p>I think I should start treating JavaScript also that way.</p>

  <p>I <a href="http://yuvi.in/blog/moving-to-vim-from-emacs.html">moved</a> from emacs to vim a while ago, and have been steadily accumulating a series of plugins in my <code>.vim</code>. They&#8217;re all up in my rather messy <a href="http://github.com/yuvipanda/dotfiles">dotfiles repo</a>. Here&#8217;s a slightly more neatly organized list of the plugins I currently use:</p>

<ol>
<li><a href="http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=3025">command-t</a> &#8211; File opener and buffer switcher. In-fuckin-credibly useful.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1953">vimpress</a> &#8211; What I use to blog since <a href="http://yuvi.in/blog/moving-back-to-wordpress/">moving to wordpress</a>.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=39">matchit</a> &#8211; Lets <code>%</code> work with html tags</li>
<li><s><a href="http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=3695">commentary</a> &#8211; Generic commenting and uncommenting script</s> <a href="http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1218">NERDCommenter</a> has replaced commentary due to being more flexible and having more options.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2975">fugitive</a> &#8211; Incredibly awesome git wrapper for vim. I rarely go to the commandline for git these days</li>
<li><a href="http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=3465">tagbar</a> &#8211; Useful code-exploratory plugin when I&#8217;m looking around a codebase trying to familiarize myself.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1643">supertab</a> &#8211; Buffer completion in insert mode only when I need it.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2423">gist</a> &#8211; Put stuff up in gist to pass it around</li>
<li><a href="http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=559">BufClose</a> &#8211; So I can close a buffer without messing up my splits</li>
<li><a href="http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=3509">extradite</a> &#8211; <code>:Glog</code> replacement that builds on top of fugitive. I don&#8217;t understand why this isn&#8217;t bundled with fugitive</li>
<li><a href="http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2204">TwitVim</a> &#8211; Yes, so I don&#8217;t have to go to the browser (and be consumed by chat/reddit/hn) just to post a tweet.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2572">ack.vim</a> &#8211; Ack integration for vim. Do yourself a favor and use <a href="http://betterthangrep.com">ack</a> instead of grep.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2736">Syntastic</a> &#8211; Automatic syntax checking so that I don&#8217;t miss a semicolon and not know about it</li>
<li><a href="http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1355">php-doc</a> &#8211; Insert boilerplate PHP doc compatible strings in my PHP files whenever I want to. Very PHP specific, need to find something that works across languages. (Note: This plugin has quite some identity crisis. It&#8217;s named PDV but it&#8217;s filename is php-doc. Since php-doc is more descriptive, I&#8217;m using that)</li>
<li><a href="http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2754">delimitMate</a> &#8211; Automatically closes quotes, parens, braces, etc for you. I initially thought this would be super annoying, but in fact it is rather very pleasant.</li>
</ol>

<p><s>I&#8217;m also on the default <code>desert</code> color theme &#8211; haven&#8217;t found anything better. Suggestions welcome &#8211; both for the color scheme and for new/replacement plugins.</s> After trying out <a href="http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1778">wombat</a> and <a href="http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2555">jellybeans</a> color schemes, I have settled on wombat for now.</p>

<p>Suggestions for more plugins still welcome :)</p>

<p><s>This is the list as of 24 Aug 2011.</s> <s>Updated as of September 2 2011 (added 10, 11, 12 since last update).</s> <s>Updated as of September 5 2011 (changed 4, added colorscheme change).</s> Updated as of September 12 2011 (added 13, 14, 15). I am moving quite fast, am I not? Will keep this post updated as and when things change.</p>

  <p>I was debugging an issue <a href="http://interviewstreet.com">at work</a> today where a (generated) file refused to download in Chrome, but the same URL worked just fine with wget. I remember reading in the <a href="http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec2.html#sec2.2">HTTP Spec</a> that HTTP headers can only be lower ASCII, so when wget mangled the output file&#8217;s name, the problem was obvious &#8211; the file name contained a character that wasn&#8217;t in lower ASCII (an accented A). Chrome had borked on encountering it, while wget soldiered on. Using <code>iconv</code> to strip non-ASCII characters in the file name on the server side fixed the issue.</p>

<p>Moral of the story? Read the RFCs! The <a href="http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616.html">HTTP one</a>, in particular, is remarkably readable and you <em>should</em> read it if you&#8217;re doing non-trivial Web Development.</p>

<p>P.S: If I had had time, I&#8217;d have went around testing this behavior in several user agents and documenting their behavior (and possibly submitting bug reports) &#8211; but <insert-excuse-here>.</p>
