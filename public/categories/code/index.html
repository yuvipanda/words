<p>I&rsquo;m writing up monthly &lsquo;work plans&rsquo; to plan what work I&rsquo;m trying to do every
month, and do a retrospective after to see how much I got done. I work across
a variety of open source projects with ambiguous responsibilities, so work
planning isn&rsquo;t very set. This has proven to be somewhat quite stressful for
everyone involved. Let&rsquo;s see if this helps!</p>

<h2 id="jupytercon">JupyterCon</h2>

<p>JupyterCon is in NYC towards the end of August, and it is going to set the pace
for a bunch of stuff. I have 2.5-ish talks to give. Need to prepare for those and
do a good job.</p>

<h2 id="matomo-formerly-piwiki-on-mybinder-org">Matomo (formerly Piwiki) on mybinder.org</h2>

<p>mybinder.org currently uses Google Analytics. I am not a big fan. It has troubling
privacy implications, and we don&rsquo;t get data as granularly as we want to. I am going
to try deploying <a href="https://matomo.org/">Matomo</a> (formerly Piwiki) and using that
instead. Run both together for a while and see how we like it! Matomo requires
a MySQL database &amp; is written in PHP - let&rsquo;s see how this goes ;)</p>

<h2 id="the-littlest-jupyterhub-0-1-release">The Littlest JupyterHub 0.1 release</h2>

<p><a href="https://github.com/jupyterhub/the-littlest-jupyterhub">The Littlest JupyterHub</a> is
doing great! I&rsquo;ve done a <strong>lot</strong> of user tests, and the distribution has changed
drastically over time. It&rsquo;s also the first time I&rsquo;m putting my newly found
strong convictions around testing, CI &amp; documentation to practice. You can already
check it out <a href="https://github.com/jupyterhub/the-littlest-jupyterhub">on GitHub</a>. I
want to make sure we (the JupyterHub team) gets out a 0.1 release early August.</p>

<h2 id="pangeo-workshop">Pangeo Workshop</h2>

<p>I despair about climate change and how little agency I seem to have around it
quite a bit. I&rsquo;m excited to go to the <a href="https://www2.cisl.ucar.edu/events/workshops/2018-pangeo-workshop/2018/2018-pangeo-workshop">PANGEO workshop</a>
in Colorado. I&rsquo;m mostly hoping to listen &amp; understand their world some more.</p>

<h2 id="berkeley-datahub-deployment">Berkeley DataHub deployment</h2>

<p>Aug 20-ish is when next semester starts at UC Berkeley. I need to have a pretty
solid JupyterHub running there by then. I&rsquo;d like it to have good CI/CD set up
in a generic way, rather than something super specific to Berkeley. However,
I&rsquo;m happy to shortcut this if needed, since there&rsquo;s already so many things on
my plate haha.</p>

<h2 id="uc-davis">UC Davis</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;m trying to spend a day or two a month at UC Davis. Partially because I like
being on Amtrak! I also think there&rsquo;s a lot of cool work happening there,
and I&rsquo;d like to hang out with all the cool people doing all the cool work.</p>

<h2 id="personal">Personal</h2>

<p>On top of this, there&rsquo;s ongoing medical conditions to be managed. I&rsquo;m getting
Carpel Tunnel Release surgery sometime in October, so need to make sure I do
not super fuck up my hands before then. I&rsquo;m also getting a cortisone shot
for my back in early August to deal with Sciatica. Fun!</p>

<h2 id="things-i-m-not-doing">Things I&rsquo;m not doing!</h2>

<p>The grading related stuff I&rsquo;ve been working on is going to the backburner
for a while. I think I bit off far more than I can chew, so time to back off.
I also do not have a good intuition for the problem domain since I&rsquo;ve never
written grading keys nor have I been a student in a class that got autograded.</p>

<h2 id="in-conclusion">In conclusion&hellip;</h2>

<p>Shit, I&rsquo;ve a lot of things to do lol! I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;m forgetting some things
here that I&rsquo;ve promised people. Let&rsquo;s see how this goes!</p>

<p>Inspired by conversations with <a href="https://github.com/bollwyvl">Nick Bollweg</a> and
<a href="http://matthewrocklin.com/">Matt Rocklin</a>, I experimented with using
<a href="https://github.com/conda/constructor">conda constructor</a> as the installer for
<a href="http://words.yuvi.in/post/the-littlest-jupyterhub/">The Littlest JupyterHub</a>.
Theoretically, it fit the bill perfectly - I wanted a way to ship arbitrary
packages in multiple languages (python &amp; node) in an easy to install self-contained way,
didn&rsquo;t want to make debian packages &amp; wanted to use a tool that people in the Jupyter
ecosystem were familiar with. Constructor seemed to provide just that.</p>

<p>I sortof got it working, but in the end ran into enough structural problems that
I decided it isn&rsquo;t the right tool for this job. This blog post is a note to my
future self on <em>why</em>.</p>

<p>This isn&rsquo;t a &lsquo;takedown&rsquo; of conda or conda constructor - just a particular
use case where it didn&rsquo;t work out and a demonstration of how little I know
about conda. It probably works great if you are doing more scientific computing
and less &lsquo;ship a software system&rsquo;!</p>

<h2 id="does-not-work-with-conda-forge">Does not work with <code>conda-forge</code></h2>

<p>I &lt;3 <a href="https://conda-forge.org/">conda-forge</a> and the community around
it. I know there&rsquo;s a nice <a href="https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/jupyterhub">jupyterhub</a>
package there, which takes care of installing JupyterHub, node, and required
node modules.</p>

<p>However, this doesn&rsquo;t actually work. conda constructor does not support
<a href="https://www.anaconda.com/blog/developer-blog/condas-new-noarch-packages/">noarch packages</a>,
and JupyterHub relies on several <code>noarch</code> packages. From my understanding,
more <code>conda-forge</code> packages are moving towards being <code>noarch</code> (for good reason!).</p>

<p>Looking at <a href="https://github.com/conda/constructor/issues/86">this issue</a>,
it doesn&rsquo;t look like this is a high priority item for them to fix anytime soon.
I understand that - they don&rsquo;t owe the world free work! It just makes conda
constructor a no-go for my use case&hellip;</p>

<h2 id="no-support-for-pip">No support for pip</h2>

<p>You can pip install packages in a conda environment, and they mostly just work.
There are a <em>lot</em> of python packages on PyPI that are installable via pip that
I&rsquo;d like to use. constructor doesn&rsquo;t support bundling these, which is entirely
fair! <a href="https://github.com/conda/constructor/pull/96">This PR</a> attempted something
here, but was rejected.</p>

<p>So if I want to keep using packages that don&rsquo;t exist in <code>conda-forge</code> yet but
do exist in pip, I would have to make sure these packages and all their dependencies
exist as conda packages too. This would be fine if constructor was giving
me enough value to justify it, but right now it is not. I&rsquo;ve also tried going
down a similar road (<em>cough</em> debian <em>cough</em>) and did not want to do that again :)</p>

<h2 id="awkward-post-install-bash">Awkward <code>post-install.bash</code></h2>

<p>I wanted to set up systemd units post install. Right off the bat this should
have made me realize conda constructor was not the right tool for the job :D
The only injected environment variable is <code>$PREFIX</code>, which is not super helpful
if you wanna do stuff like &lsquo;copy this systemd unit file somewhere&rsquo;. I ended up
writing a small python module that does all these things, and calling it from
post-install. However, even then I couldn&rsquo;t pass any environment variables to it,
making testing / CI hard.</p>

<h2 id="current-solution">Current solution</h2>

<p>Currently, we have a <a href="https://github.com/yuvipanda/the-littlest-jupyterhub/blob/9cc05a9d627515a01b68e244a970079481be7d9e/installer/install.bash">bootstrap script</a>
that downloads miniconda, &amp; bootstraps from there to a full JupyterHub install.
Things like systemd units &amp; sudo rules are managed by a <a href="https://github.com/yuvipanda/the-littlest-jupyterhub/tree/9cc05a9d627515a01b68e244a970079481be7d9e/tljh">python module</a>
that is called from the bootstrap script.</p>

  <p>Recently I had to write some code that had to call the kubernetes API directly,
without any language wrappers. While there is pretty good <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/">reference docs</a>,
I didn&rsquo;t want to go and construct all the JSON manually in my programming language.</p>

<p>I discovered that <code>kubectl</code>&rsquo;s <code>-v</code> parameter is very useful for this! With this,
I can do the following:</p>

<ol>
<li>Perform the actions I need to perform with just <code>kubectl</code> commands</li>
<li>Pass <code>-v=8</code> to kubectl when doing this, and this will print all the HTTP traffic
(requests and responses!) in an easy to read way</li>
<li>Copy paste the JSON requests and template them as needed!</li>
</ol>

<p>This was very useful! The fact you can see the response bodies is also nice,
since it gives you a good intuition of how to handle this in your own code.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re shelling out to <code>kubectl</code> directly in your code (for some reason!),
you can also use this to figure out all the RBAC rules your code would need. For
example, if I&rsquo;m going to run the following in my script:</p>

<pre><code class="language-bash">kubectl get node
</code></pre>

<p>and need to figure out which RBAC rules are needed for this, I can run:</p>

<pre><code class="language-bash">kubectl -v=8 get node 2&gt;&amp;1 | grep -P 'GET|POST|DELETE|PATCH|PUT'
</code></pre>

<p>This should list all the API requests the code is making, making it easier
to figure out what rules are needed.</p>

<p>Note that you might have to <code>rm -rf ~/.kube/cache</code> to &lsquo;really&rsquo; get the
full API requests list, since <code>kubectl</code> caches a bunch of API autodiscovery.
The minimum RBAC for kubectl is:</p>

<pre><code class="language-yaml">kind: ClusterRole
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1beta1
metadata:
  name: kubectl-minimum
rules:
- nonResourceURLs: [&quot;/api&quot;, &quot;/apis/*&quot;]
  verbs: [&quot;get&quot;]
</code></pre>

<p>You will need to add additional rules for the specific commands you
want to execute.</p>

  <p><em>Note: I&#8217;m trying to spend time explicitly writing random side projects that are not related to what I&#8217;m actively working on as my main project in some form.</em></p>

<p>A random thread started by <a href="https://twitter.com/quominus">Ironholds</a> on a random mailing list I was wearily catching up on contained a joke from <a href="https://twitter.com/bearloga">bearloga</a> about malformed User Agents. This prompted me to write <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/uauliver/?src=search">UAuliver</a> (<a href="https://github.com/yuvipanda/uauliver-firefox-extension">source</a>), a Firefox extension that randomizes your user agent to be a random string of emoji. This breaks a surprisingly large number of software, I&#8217;m told! (GMail &amp; Gerrit being the ones I explicitly remember)</p>

<p>Things I learnt from writing this:</p>

<ol>
<li>Writing Addons for Firefox is far easier to get started with than they were the last time I looked. Despite the confusing naming (Jetpack API == SDK != WordPress&#8217; Jetpack API != Addons != Plugins != WebExtension), the documentation and tooling were nice enough that I could finish all of this in a few hours!</li>
<li>I can still write syntactically correct Javascript! \o/</li>
<li>Generating a &#8216;string of emoji&#8217; is easier/harder than you would think, depending on how you would like to define &#8217;emoji&#8217;. The fact that Unicode deals in blocks that at least in this case aren&#8217;t too split up made this quite easy (I used the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emoji#Unicode_blocks">list</a> on Wikipedia to generate them). JS&#8217;s <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/fromCodePoint">String.fromCodePoint</a> can also be used to detect if the codepoint you just generated randomly is actually allocated.</li>
<li>I don&#8217;t actually know how HTTP headers deal with encoding and unicode. This is something I need to actually look up. Perhaps a re-read of the HTTP RfC is in order!</li>
</ol>

<p>It was a fun exercise, and I might write more Firefox extensions in the future!</p>

  <p><code>localhost</code> is always <code>127.0.0.1</code>, right? Nope, can also be <code>::1</code> if your system only has IPV6 (apparently).</p>

<p>Asking a DNS server for an A record for <code>localhost</code> should give you back <code>127.0.0.1</code> right? Nope &#8211; it varies wildly! <code>8.8.8.8</code> gives me an <code>NXDOMAIN</code> which means it tells you straight up THIS DOMAIN DOES NOT EXIST! Which is true, since localhost isn&#8217;t a domain. But if you ask the same thing of any dnsmasq server, it&#8217;ll tell you localhost is 127.0.0.1. Other servers vary wildly &#8211; I found one that returned an <code>NXDOMAIN</code> for AAAA but 127.0.0.1 for A (which is pretty wild, since <code>NXDOMAIN</code> makes most software treat the domain as not existing and not attempt other lookups). So localhost and DNS servers don&#8217;t mix very well.</p>

<p>But why is this a problem, in general? Most DNS resolution happens via <code>gethostbyname</code> libc call, which reads <code>/etc/hosts</code> properly, right? Problem there is that there is popular software that&#8217;s completely asynchronous (_cough_nginx<em>cough</em>) that does <em>not</em> use <code>gethostbyname</code> (since that&#8217;s synchronous) and directly queries DNS servers (asynchronously). This works perfectly well until you try to hit <code>localhost</code> and it tells you &#8216;no such thing!&#8217;.</p>

<p>I should probably file a bug with nginx to have them read <code>/etc/hosts</code> as well, and in the mean-time work around by sending <code>127.0.0.1</code> to nginx rather than localhost.</p>

<p>How did <em>your</em> thursday go?</p>

  <p>(As requested by <a href="https://twitter.com/JeanFred">Jean-Fred</a>)</p>

<p>One of the &#8216;pain points&#8217; with working on deploying python stuff at Wikimedia is that <code>pip</code> and <code>virtualenvs</code> are banned on production, for some (what I now understand as) good reasons (the solid Signing / Security issues with PYPI, and the slightly less solid but nonetheless valid &#8216;If we use pip for python and gem for ruby and npm for node, EXPLOSION OF PACKAGE MANAGERS and makes things harder to manage&#8217;). I was whining about how hard debian packaging was for quite a while without checking how easy/hard it was to package python specifically, and when I finally did, it turned out to be quite not that hard.</p>

<p>Use <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/stdeb">python-stdeb</a>.</p>

<p>Really, that is it. Ignore most other things (until you run into issues that require them :P). It can translate most python packages that are packaged for PyPI into .debs that mostly pass <a href="https://lintian.debian.org/">lintian</a> checks. Simplest way to package, that I&#8217;ve been following for a while is:</p>

<ol>
<li>Install <code>python-stdeb</code> (from pip or apt). Usually requires the packages <code>python-all</code>, <code>fakeroot</code> and <code>build-essential</code>, although for some reason these aren&#8217;t required by the debian package for <code>stdeb</code>. Make sure you&#8217;re on the same distro you are building the package for.</li>
<li><code>git clone</code> the package from its source</li>
<li>Run <code>python setup.py --command-packages=stdeb.command bdist_deb</code> (or <code>python3</code> if you want to make Python 3 package)</li>
<li>Run <code>lintian</code> on it. If it spots errors, go back and fix them, usually by editing the <code>setup.py</code> file (or sometimes a <code>stdeb.cfg</code> file). This is usually rather obvious and easy enough to fix.</li>
<li>Run <code>dpkg -i &lt;package&gt;</code> to try to install the package. This will error out if it can&#8217;t find the packages that your package depends on. This means that they haven&#8217;t been packaged for debian yet. You can mostly fix this by finding that package, and making a deb for it, and installing it as well (recursively making debs for packages as you need them). While this sounds onerous, the fact is that most python packages already exist as deb packages and you <code>stdeb</code> will just work for them. You might have to do this more if you&#8217;re packaging for an older distro (<em>cough</em> <em>cough</em> <code>precise</code> <em>cough</em> <em>cough</em>), but is much easier on newer distros.</li>
<li>Put your package in a repository! If you want to use this on Wikimedia Labs, you should use <a href="https://wikitech.wikimedia.org/wiki/Help:Using_debs_in_labs">Labsdebrepo</a>. Other environments will have similar ways to make the package available via <code>apt-get</code>. Avoid the temptation to just <code>dpkg -i</code> it on machines manually :)</li>
</ol>

<p>That&#8217;s pretty much it! Much simpler than I originally expected, and not much confusing / conflicting docs. The docs for <code>stdeb</code> are pretty nice and complete, so do read these!</p>

<p>Will update the post as I learn more.</p>

  <p>I&#8217;ve started paying for <a href="https://irccloud.com">IRCCloud</a>.</p>

<p>It is the first &#8216;service&#8217; I am paying for as a subscriber, I think. I&#8217;ve considered doing that for a long time, but &#8216;paying for IRC&#8217; just felt&#8230; odd. I&#8217;ve been using <a href="http://wiki.znc.in/ZNC">ZNC</a> + <a href="http://limechat.net/mac/">LimeChat</a>. It&#8217;s decent, but sucks on Mobile. Keeping a socket open all the time on a phone just kills the battery, plus the UX on most Android clients sucks.</p>

<p>So after seeing <a href="http://samsmith.io/">Sam Smith</a> use IRCCloud during Wikimania, I made the plunge and paid for IRCCloud. It is still connecting to my bouncer, so I have logs under my control. It also has a very usable Android client, and syncs &#8216;read&#8217; status across devices, and is quite fast.</p>

<p>Convenience and UX won over &#8216;Free Software&#8217; this time.</p>

  <p>&#8220;Write once, attempt to debug everywhere&#8221; is probably way more accurate than &#8220;Write once, run anywhere&#8221; &#8211; at least for GUI apps. There&#8217;s something rather special about ideas that are theoretically amazingly wonderful yet end up being a major pain in the butt when you try to put them in practice, isn&#8217;t it?</p>

<p>The older <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.wikipedia">Wikipedia App</a> happened to be in <a href="http://phonegap.com/">PhoneGap</a>, and I consider it one of my biggest blunders to not have torn it down on day 0 and rewritten it in something saner. I once started writing a blog post for the <a href="https://blog.wikimedia.org">Wikimedia Blog</a> about why we switched from PhoneGap to native apps, but it was killed for having too much profanity in it :) Someday, perhaps.</p>

  <p>Somehow: <code>( $a &amp;&amp; $b ) || ( $b &amp;&amp; $c ) || ( $a &amp;&amp; $c )</code></p>

<p>Became: <code>$a ? ( $b || $c ) : ( $b &amp;&amp; $c )</code></p>

<p>Became: <code>count( array_filter( array( $a, $b, $c ) ) ) &gt;= 2</code></p>

<p>Became: <code>&quot;$a$b$c&quot; &gt; 1</code></p>

<p>God dammit PHP&#8230;</p>

<p>(from discussion among me, ^d, ori-l, bd808 and anomie on <code>#mediawiki-core</code> about how to represent &#8216;if at least 2 of three conditions are true&#8217;)</p>
