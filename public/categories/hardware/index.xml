      <description>I walked into a local hardware store, with the following thought in my mind:&#xA;I need a 5mm metric hex key&#xA;And I wandered around aimlessly as I do in stores, almost bought some double sided tape for a different project (decided against it), and eventually made it to the place with all the sockets, hex keys, screwdrivers, etc.&#xA;Words that previously meant nothing to me (Torx, SAE, metric) made sense.</description>
