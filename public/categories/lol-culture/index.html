  <p>This is a best effort translation of the song &#8216;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wK7shf-5soU">Clubbule Mabbule</a>&#8216; (Drunk in a Club) from Tamil to English.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><pre>(Come on, I smoke, I drink, I&rsquo;m in a live in relationship)
Fuck, get lost. This is modern culture, eh?
If you call this westernization modern culture,
then this song is dedicated right for you.
Hip hop tamizha, your Aaadheeee.</p>

<p>Women roaming around drunk in clubs
What the fuck is happening in Tamil Nadu
I salute you all
All your honor is flying away</p>

<p>Women roaming around drunk in clubs
What the fuck is happening in Tamil Nadu
I salute you all
All your honor is flying away</p>

<p>Hi girls, first you say &lsquo;how are you?&rsquo;
After knowing me for 10 months you say
&lsquo;Who are you?&rsquo;
Just three words &lsquo;I love you&rsquo;
Don&rsquo;t you even know the meaning of that?</p>

<p>Hey Sheena, Leena, Meena, Veena,
Don&rsquo;t show off as knowing only little bits
of tamil with a foreign accent,
If you leave Tamil Nadu and go out,
does not mean you have to forget your mother tongue Tamil</p>

<p>Rohini, Yohini, Yamini, Kamini,
Think they are hot but are actually funny,
Don&rsquo;t blame men pointlessly,
(He is looking at me only!) Why do you do this?</p>

<p>Women roaming around drunk in clubs
What the fuck is happening in Tamil Nadu
I salute you all
All your honor is flying away</p>

<p>Women roaming around drunk in clubs
What the fuck is happening in Tamil Nadu
I salute you all
All your honor is flying away</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not blaming all women,
The deity who gave birth to me is also a woman.
All the guys come to my side,
or these girls will spoil you as well</p>

<p>Of 100, 50 are like these,
Roaming around clubs drinking and smoking,
From the time when women cooked nice food,
OH MY GOD NOW THEY ARE SMOOKING GANJA WHAT A SHAME</p>

<p>Women roaming around drunk in clubs
What the fuck is happening in Tamil Nadu
I salute you all
All your honor is flying away</p>

<p>Women roaming around drunk in clubs
What the fuck is happening in Tamil Nadu
I salute you all
All your honor is flying away</p>

<p>Pretty woman, with pretty eyes
BUT SHE HAS ONE BOTTLE OF RUM!</p>

<p>Pretty woman, with pretty eyes,
BUT WITH RUM SHE HAS HALF A PACK OF CIGARETTES</p>

<p>Pretty fairy, I don&rsquo;t need you,
You are dancing heavily drunk.</p>

<p>Gone are the times when women wore jewellery,
Now they keep smoking everywhere.
Instead of wearing sarees,
THEY ARE WEARING HANDKERCHEIFS!</p>

<p>Women roaming around drunk in clubs
What the fuck is happening in Tamil Nadu

<p>Women roaming around drunk in clubs

All your honor is flying away</p>

<p>Gone are the times when women wore jewellery,
Now they keep smoking everywhere.
Instead of wearing sarees,
THEY ARE WEARING HANDKERCHEIFS!
THEY ARE WEARING HANDKERCHEIFS!
(Shows handkerchief for emphasis)</pre></p>

<p>As far as I know, this is not satire.</p>
