      <title>Something that seems to drive me: Part I</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve had a bit of a slump the last few months, working through what feels&#xA;like deep mental fog for totally unclear reasons. The lack of clarity on&#xA;causation is one of the most frustrating parts of this, and one of the&#xA;most familiar too - this isn&amp;rsquo;t the first time I&amp;rsquo;ve felt like this, and I know&#xA;(rationally at least, if not emotionally) it won&amp;rsquo;t be the last. Probably a&#xA;combination of intensely avoiding making some decision that seems too big&#xA;to be made by me without actually knowing what it is and fun brain chemicals&#xA;stuff. Who knows, I&amp;rsquo;ve given up on trying to figure out causality for these&#xA;things for the most part.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
