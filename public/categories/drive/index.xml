      <title>Something that seems to drive me: Part I</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve had a bit of a slump the last few months, working through what feels like deep mental fog for totally unclear reasons. The lack of clarity on causation is one of the most frustrating parts of this, and one of the most familiar too - this isn&amp;rsquo;t the first time I&amp;rsquo;ve felt like this, and I know (rationally at least, if not emotionally) it won&amp;rsquo;t be the last. Probably a combination of intensely avoiding making some decision that seems too big to be made by me without actually knowing what it is and fun brain chemicals stuff.</description>
