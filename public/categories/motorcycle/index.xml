      <description>I decided to write publicly and publish my motorcycle riding trip notes now.&#xA;Montarey Trip notes Need to learn to plan when to pee. This is important to do! Can&amp;rsquo;t just get off any exit, as that often doesn&amp;rsquo;t actually lead to wilderness but to more concrete jungles.&#xA;Need to learn more about lane splitting and how and when to do it safely. I did it for a little bit while stuck on CA-1S, but was avoiding it for most of the ride.</description>
