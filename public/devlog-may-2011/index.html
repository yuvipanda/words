<h3 id="may-25-june-13">May 25-June 13</h3>

<p>Loads of things happened.</p>

<p>Finished/polished up ShortUrl. Pending review. Would go into not just tawiki, but possibly all wmf wikis. YAY!</p>

<p>Moved to a dual monitor setup. Dual 23&#8243; Monitors, one Samsung LED and one Acer LCD. Also moved to 8G of RAM. VMs are much less painful now.</p>

<p>Did a few back/forths with the GSoC extension architecture. It&#8217;s still blocking, so working with the non-blocking parts of GSoC now.</p>

<p>Moved to bangalore, atleast temperoarily for now.</p>

<p>Did a tiny bit of work for a friend organizing MP3s with a script. Was fun, operating at that scale. Helped me get back in touch with bash/awk etc.</p>

<p>Rooted/Flashed my Galaxy 3 with a custom ROM. SO MUCH FRIGGIN BETTER, WHY DID I NOT DO THIS BEFORE? The audio is now atleast a few orders of magnitude better.</p>

<p>Moved blog to wordpress. Archived the HiSlain project.</p>

<p>Got my camera. Need to postprocess more. But still :D</p>

<h3 id="may-25">May 25</h3>

<p>Put in a lot of effort into ShortUrl. Want to finish it up and push it to prod before &#8216;leaving&#8217;. Also learnt a bit more vimfoo. Moved it to svn and got it ready in translatewiki</p>

<h3 id="may-17-24">May 17-24</h3>

<p>Nothing positive done. Whatsoever. At all. Exams done, yeah. That&#8217;s about it.</p>

<h3 id="may-16">May 16</h3>

<p>Some TwitterBots work. Increased vim-fu a bit more. Got started on interviewStreet.</p>

<p>Also some work done on new version of ShortURL extension.</p>

<h3 id="may-13-15">May 13-15</h3>

<p>Talked out with mentor about components in my GSoC. Got toolserver account. More work on MarathonSin &#8211; @ssnbot now runs on it. Moved them all to a server. Increased my vim-fu a bit. Released 2 new versions of yenWikipedia, using a cache to reduce network traffic.</p>

<p>Still not productive enough. The number of Commits I&#8217;m doing per day is at an all time low&#8230;</p>

<h3 id="may-12-13">May 12-13</h3>

<p>Wrote MarathonSin (Declarative Twitter Bots) to keep myself awake. Started on the detailed plans for Mediawiki GSoC.</p>

<p>NEED.TO.BE.MORE.PRODUCTIVE.AAARRGGHHH</p>

<h3 id="may-10-11">May 10-11</h3>

<p>Nothing got done for last 3 days. Tried resetting sleep cycle twice, failed.</p>

<p>Did some SICP exercises. Whiteboarded components for GSoC. Nothing much. Sigh.</p>

<h3 id="may-9">May 9</h3>

<p>Reasonably productive day.</p>

<p>Finished PoC. Talked about bringing back ShortUrl Development. Started doing design work for rest of GSoC project. Read up on MySQL a bit more.</p>

<p>The other thing is coming along nicely too.</p>

<h3 id="may-8">May 8</h3>

<p>Not very productive day again.</p>

<p>Wrote sql for PoC. Read up on the db functions. Looks like I&#8217;ll be done with the PoC by monday.</p>

<p>Went on a Star Trek mini-binge. Tapestry was incredibly timely, even more than usual. Ended with me laughing alongside Picard when he gets finally stabbed. I think I made the right decision :)</p>

<h3 id="may-7">May 7</h3>

<p>Half of PoC is done. Calling it GPoC. Went off to sleep, but couldn&#8217;t so came back and worked. Feels good.</p>

<p>Have a basic extension. Figured out that I can&#8217;t just grab a preprocessed DOM off any hook. Need to work that out, but since this is just a &#8216;Proof of Concept&#8217;, I can get away with just running preprocess again. Also investigated the Job Queue and the data table update stuff.</p>

<p>Helped out @msnarain with the #goldenrulesofchennai bit. Wrote code to retreive more tweets further back out.</p>

<h3 id="may-6">May 6</h3>

<p>Need to break free. Not productive much. Got started on PoC. Ran around trying to get myself camera. Failed.</p>

<p>Helped msnarain with some &#8216;goldenrulesofchennai&#8217; bits. Let&#8217;s see how that works out.</p>

<p>Three days of failure in one day.</p>

<p>Ah, took heart after that, sketched out plan for completing PoC. Looks like one &#8211; two days work to me now. Let&#8217;s see :)</p>

<h3 id="may-5">May 5</h3>

<p>Again, not much code. Slight work on geekweekend.in. More progress on planning for PoC. Turns out I don&#8217;t have much of a chance making it to Israel. Sigh.</p>

<p>Again, not a very productive day.</p>

<h3 id="may-4">May 4</h3>

<p>Nice productive discussions with rkirti about various issues. Thanks for doing that :)</p>

<p>Started writing design docs for my GSoC Project. Need to codename that.</p>

<p>Unproductive day code wise.</p>

<h3 id="may-3">May 3</h3>

<p>My Language Wikipedia works on DuckDuckGo standard. Had given up getting it to work, but the DDG guys pinged me on twitter about it and I <em>had</em> to respect that, no?</p>

<p>My pull req for opensearch module was accepted. Yay.</p>

<p>Made geekcalendar.in. Built a very very tiny static generator that generates it. Deployed it. Tried compass/sass, but in the end came back to plain blueprint+CSS.</p>

<p>Got Ubuntu+Unity and Win7+Photoshop+Fireworks to work under Virtualbox. Yay! Fixed hard disk too.</p>

<h3 id="may-2">May 2</h3>

<p>Started talking to awjr about beginning GSoC work. My prelim work starts tomorrow, with a Proof of Concept.</p>

<p>Started work on making My Language Wikipedia work on DuckDuckGo.com as well.</p>

<p>Also started work on transliterated search for wikipedia. Fundamental ideas are in place.</p>

<p>Made a commit + pull req for opensearch python module, to let it support setting useragent (since wikipedia will 403 you if you don&#8217;t identify yourself)</p>

<p>Met vimzard, sujeet, kashyap and others today. Was fun. vimzard has grown taller.</p>

<h3 id="may-1">May 1</h3>

<p>Made two releases of My Language Wikipedia extension (formerly yenWikipedia). Works in Google Instant, and Options page auto opens now.</p>

<p>Did some brainfuck related language work. Should complete those soon.</p>

<p>Bought a new domain (geekcalendar.in). Should build/launch it soon.</p>
