I [moved][1] from emacs to vim a while ago, and have been steadily accumulating a series of plugins in my `.vim`. They're all up in my rather messy [dotfiles repo][2]. Here's a slightly more neatly organized list of the plugins I currently use:

1. [command-t][ct] - File opener and buffer switcher. In-fuckin-credibly useful.
2. [vimpress][vp] - What I use to blog since [moving to wordpress][mtwp].
3. [matchit][mit] - Lets `%` work with html tags
4. <s>[commentary][ctry] - Generic commenting and uncommenting script</s> [NERDCommenter][nerdcommenter] has replaced commentary due to being more flexible and having more options.
5. [fugitive][fgtive] - Incredibly awesome git wrapper for vim. I rarely go to the commandline for git these days
6. [tagbar][tagbar] - Useful code-exploratory plugin when I'm looking around a codebase trying to familiarize myself.
7. [supertab][supertab] - Buffer completion in insert mode only when I need it.
8. [gist][gist] - Put stuff up in gist to pass it around
9. [BufClose][bc] - So I can close a buffer without messing up my splits
10. [extradite][extradite] - `:Glog` replacement that builds on top of fugitive. I don't understand why this isn't bundled with fugitive
11. [TwitVim][twitvim] - Yes, so I don't have to go to the browser (and be consumed by chat/reddit/hn) just to post a tweet.
12. [ack.vim][ackvim] - Ack integration for vim. Do yourself a favor and use [ack][ack] instead of grep.
13. [Syntastic][syntastic] - Automatic syntax checking so that I don't miss a semicolon and not know about it
14. [php-doc][php-doc] - Insert boilerplate PHP doc compatible strings in my PHP files whenever I want to. Very PHP specific, need to find something that works across languages. (Note: This plugin has quite some identity crisis. It's named PDV but it's filename is php-doc. Since php-doc is more descriptive, I'm using that)
15. [delimitMate][delimit] - Automatically closes quotes, parens, braces, etc for you. I initially thought this would be super annoying, but in fact it is rather very pleasant.

<s>I'm also on the default `desert` color theme - haven't found anything better. Suggestions welcome - both for the color scheme and for new/replacement plugins.</s> After trying out [wombat][wombat] and [jellybeans][jellybeans] color schemes, I have settled on wombat for now. 

Suggestions for more plugins still welcome :)

<s>This is the list as of 24 Aug 2011.</s> <s>Updated as of September 2 2011 (added 10, 11, 12 since last update).</s> <s>Updated as of September 5 2011 (changed 4, added colorscheme change).</s> Updated as of September 12 2011 (added 13, 14, 15). I am moving quite fast, am I not? Will keep this post updated as and when things change.
