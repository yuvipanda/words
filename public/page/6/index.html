      <p>Not very code heavy</p>
<ul>
<li>Couple of pull requests(<a href="https://github.com/atom/autosave/pull/22">#1</a> and <a href="https://github.com/atom/autosave/pull/21">#2</a>) for the <a href="https://github.com/atom/autosave">Atom Autosave plugin</a>. One adds a preference to not autosave by when you are explicitly closing a window / pane, and the other just sets the ‘enabled’ preference to default. CoffeeScript isn’t too bad either! I should consider writing more plugins (I currently use Atom for CSS/JS/Puppet, should try other languages)</li>
<li>Added CSV, TSV and JSON download options to Quarry. There’s another Webinar tomorrow by the Grantmaking team, and J-Mo asked for it. Streaming TSV and CSV implemented in a neat way, will write a blog post tomorrow about it.</li>
<li>Started work on a ‘number of editors’ per country metric for WPDMZ, needs to be finished up.</li>
</ul>
<p>I feel a bit exhausted (physically and mentally) from the intense coding over the last few weeks, might have a few chill days to recharge myself. I’m growing old! :(</p>

      <p>Wooooo!</p>
<ul>
<li>Moved <a href="https://github.com/yuvipanda/labsbooks">labsbooks</a> (described in <a href="http://yuvi.in/blog/devlog-23-aug-2014/">yesterday’s devlog</a>) to use a shared readonly IPython virtualenv maintained by me. Also installed a bunch of modules people might want to use (SciPy, NumPy, Pandas, PyTables, matplotlib). Am considering just installing IPython notebook globally via puppet and using that, since that’ll enable users to just use the system packages. However, the version of IPython notebook from Ubuntu is ancient, so that’s probably a non-starter.</li>
<li>Have a basic version of the IPython publishing process working! Any toollabs user can create a notebook by:
<ul>
<li>Creating a <code>~/notebooks</code> folder</li>
<li>Doing a <code>chmod +x ~/notebooks</code></li>
<li>Doing a <code>chmod +x ~</code></li>
<li>Putting IPython notebooks into <code>~/notebooks</code> (as <code>.ipynb</code>) files</li>
<li>Going to <code>https://tools.wmflabs.org/notebooks/&lt;user-shell-name&gt;/&lt;path-to-ipynb-file&gt;</code> Will have to do a bit more work before it can be considered ‘production grade’ (such as user pages, a nicer theme, etc, etc) BUT YAY GOOD START. It already caches the html output in Redis and invalidates with the <code>mtime</code> of the file, so should be pretty quick.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Made the ssh tunneling process for <code>labsbooks</code> purely python, without requiring the <code>ProxyCommand</code>. This makes things simpler (and more portable!). I’ll need to work on securing this properly before I can publish it for broader use.</li>
<li>Wrote <a href="https://lists.wikimedia.org/pipermail/analytics/2014-August/002437.html">an email</a> to the analytics mailing list about making public the ‘edits per country’ data. I hope to make this publicly available with enough granularity that not just me but others can use this for fun research as well.</li>
</ul>
<p>I’ve been using <a href="https://atom.io">Atom</a> for puppet stuff, <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/">PyCharm</a> for Python and <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/">IntelliJ</a> for Java stuff, and that seems to be doing ok. They all have decent Vim keybindings as well, and good replacements for other functionality – and I might stick with Atom for a while to see how it goes :)</p>

      <p>Back in Glasgow! It was actually not very cold today, only cold! Progress.</p>
<p>Started working on my long-abandoned <code>labsbook</code> project, which aims to make <a href="https://tools.wmflabs.org">Tool Labs</a> a first class environment for people who want to run (and publish) <a href="http://ipython.org/notebook.html">iPython Notebooks</a> while also being able to access the replica databases and the dumps. Doing this in a secure manner is kinda hard, but I think I’ve a neat solution that lets everyone run a personal iPython kernel on the Grid, access it from their local machine, and also publish it to the web from a standard location. So far, I’ve gotten my script to a point where it’ll setup an iPython environment for you if it doesn’t already exist, start the kernel if it isn’t already running, and tunnel the editing interface back to you to use! Things left to do include:</p>
<ol>
<li>Open up the browser when tunnel is open</li>
<li>Find a sane way to kill a kernel that hasn’t been doing anything since forever</li>
<li>Setup a shared iPython environment (just code, readonly) so people don’t have to setup their own environments everytime (this is primarily a performance enhancement)</li>
<li>Find a nice and simple way for iPython notebooks to be published. I’m currently thinking of an URL such as <code>tools.wmflabs.org/notebooks/&lt;username&gt;/&lt;notebookname&gt;' to display them, and an index at</code>tools.wmflabs.org/notebooks/<!-- raw HTML omitted -->`. This shouldn’t be too hard with appropriate permission munging.</li>
</ol>
<p>I’m also using <a href="http://www.paramiko.org/">paramiko</a> for this, which makes writing SSH related code with Python a breeze. It even supports <code>proxycommand</code>! Blunders I’ve done while getting up to this point include:</p>
<ol>
<li>Running <code>jsub run.bash -mem 4G</code> instead of <code>jsub -mem 4G run.bash</code> and wondering why my script kept getting killed with OOM.</li>
<li>Trying to do a <code>pip install</code> on the Grid nodes (which don’t have build tools) instead of on <code>tools-dev</code> and wondering why running it from the commandline works but from <code>jsub</code> does not.</li>
<li>Wondering why my SSH Tunnel kept dying and trying to debug that without realizing that it was dying because the iPython process was dying because it was OOMing because of my earlier <code>jsub</code> error</li>
<li>Thinking that user accounts (rather than tool accounts) can not submit jobs to the grid, while the problem was that I had not set the <code>execute</code> bit on my script.</li>
</ol>
<p>Once this is done (I suspect tomorrow), I’ll work on getting the data from my work with <a href="https://github.com/Ironholds/WPDMZ">WPDMZ</a> into a form good enough for publicizing (removing ways of de-anonymization), and then use iPython notebooks to make graphs! This should be fun :)</p>
<p>Source so far available <a href="https://github.com/yuvipanda/labsbooks">on Github</a>. Needs more work / documentation / cleaning up.</p>

<li>Ported the code for the Wikipedia Android app automated builds to Python, and you can see it in action at <a href="http://tools.wmflabs.org/wikipedia-android-builds/">http://tools.wmflabs.org/wikipedia-android-builds/</a> now. It lets you download the latest build, and notes the last successful build time.

      <p>In Edinburgh! I’ve finally stopped spelling it as Edinborough!</p>
<ul>
<li>Added ‘user group’ functionality to Quarry, and added a <code>sudo</code> user group that does what you would think it does. Will be assigned super, super sparingly.</li>
<li>Found out that I’d have to explicitly specify charset of the database when I’m creating it or MySQL will default to a stupid charset. Forced all tables and columns to utf8 and that seems to have fixed a bunch of unicode issues. Yay?</li>
<li>Still facing occasional <code>MySQL server has gone away</code> errors with SQLAlchemy for local MySQL instance, despite asking SQLAlchemy to recycle connections every hour or so. Reduced the recycle time to 10m, hopefully that helps.</li>
<li>Read Tony Hoare’s Turing Award speech from 1980, titled <a href="http://zoo.cs.yale.edu/classes/cs422/2014/bib/hoare81emperor.pdf">“The Emperor’s Old Clothes”</a>. I think I should read more of these papers / speeches, helps keep perspective and ‘learn from history’. Lots of warnings against complexity seem to be a very common theme, and one I’ve also personally encountered many times. Recommend reading :)</li>
<li>More DMZ work! Now running edits per country stats separated by mobile vs desktop for all countries for all wikipedias! EXCITING!</li>

<ul>
<li>Fixed a stupid bug in Quarry that made it fail if MySQL decided that a column you were selecting is a <code>Decimal</code>. Fixed this in time for…</li>
<li>Helped out with a <a href="https://plus.google.com/u/0/b/117126229120807344920/events/cngcjcmm1tcn1omqpalcm686044">webinar</a> from J-Mo for people to learn SQL and do research against Wikimedia stuff with Quarry! Went without a glitch mostly, so yay :) Oren asked for an API for Quarry, I’ll investigate ways to get that done</li>
<li>Found that some queries against enwiki succeed on <code>s1.labsdb</code> but not on <code>s4.labsdb</code>. I attribute this to cache characteristics, and have switched Quarry to use s1 for now.</li>
<li>Did more work on <a href="https://github.com/Ironholds/WPDMZ">DMZ</a>, getting in place a runner / processor infrastructure and sqlite backed intermediary storage so I can write simpler code to get the data I want. Super excited to see how this goes. It’ll be much easier for me to add new queries now.</li>
<li>More work on DMZ! I had a late night sprint and split edits by mobile and desktop (and was surprised by seeing how much lesser edits came from mobile). Next would be to gather up population and internet penetration data and then GO MAKE SOME GRAPHS, probably with iPython. I’m returning to making graphs for real after, what, 6 years or so? :) I was using C# and Excel then :) /nick ExcitedPanda</li>
<li>Also made some progress on our makeshift Android CI-ish build system for the Wikipedia app. Should be done soon.</li>

      <p>(As requested by <a href="https://twitter.com/JeanFred">Jean-Fred</a>)</p>
<p>One of the ‘pain points’ with working on deploying python stuff at Wikimedia is that <code>pip</code> and <code>virtualenvs</code> are banned on production, for some (what I now understand as) good reasons (the solid Signing / Security issues with PYPI, and the slightly less solid but nonetheless valid ‘If we use pip for python and gem for ruby and npm for node, EXPLOSION OF PACKAGE MANAGERS and makes things harder to manage’). I was whining about how hard debian packaging was for quite a while without checking how easy/hard it was to package python specifically, and when I finally did, it turned out to be quite not that hard.</p>
<p>Use <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/stdeb">python-stdeb</a>.</p>
<p>Really, that is it. Ignore most other things (until you run into issues that require them :P). It can translate most python packages that are packaged for PyPI into .debs that mostly pass <a href="https://lintian.debian.org/">lintian</a> checks. Simplest way to package, that I’ve been following for a while is:</p>
<ol>
<li>Install <code>python-stdeb</code> (from pip or apt). Usually requires the packages <code>python-all</code>, <code>fakeroot</code> and <code>build-essential</code>, although for some reason these aren’t required by the debian package for <code>stdeb</code>. Make sure you’re on the same distro you are building the package for.</li>
<li><code>git clone</code> the package from its source</li>
<li>Run <code>python setup.py --command-packages=stdeb.command bdist_deb</code> (or <code>python3</code> if you want to make Python 3 package)</li>
<li>Run <code>lintian</code> on it. If it spots errors, go back and fix them, usually by editing the <code>setup.py</code> file (or sometimes a <code>stdeb.cfg</code> file). This is usually rather obvious and easy enough to fix.</li>
<li>Run <code>dpkg -i &lt;package&gt;</code> to try to install the package. This will error out if it can’t find the packages that your package depends on. This means that they haven’t been packaged for debian yet. You can mostly fix this by finding that package, and making a deb for it, and installing it as well (recursively making debs for packages as you need them). While this sounds onerous, the fact is that most python packages already exist as deb packages and you <code>stdeb</code> will just work for them. You might have to do this more if you’re packaging for an older distro (<em>cough</em> <em>cough</em> <code>precise</code> <em>cough</em> <em>cough</em>), but is much easier on newer distros.</li>
<li>Put your package in a repository! If you want to use this on Wikimedia Labs, you should use <a href="https://wikitech.wikimedia.org/wiki/Help:Using_debs_in_labs">Labsdebrepo</a>. Other environments will have similar ways to make the package available via <code>apt-get</code>. Avoid the temptation to just <code>dpkg -i</code> it on machines manually :)</li>
</ol>
<p>That’s pretty much it! Much simpler than I originally expected, and not much confusing / conflicting docs. The docs for <code>stdeb</code> are pretty nice and complete, so do read these!</p>
<p>Will update the post as I learn more.</p>

      <p>I’ve started paying for <a href="https://irccloud.com">IRCCloud</a>.</p>
<p>It is the first ‘service’ I am paying for as a subscriber, I think. I’ve considered doing that for a long time, but ‘paying for IRC’ just felt… odd. I’ve been using <a href="http://wiki.znc.in/ZNC">ZNC</a> + <a href="http://limechat.net/mac/">LimeChat</a>. It’s decent, but sucks on Mobile. Keeping a socket open all the time on a phone just kills the battery, plus the UX on most Android clients sucks.</p>
<p>So after seeing <a href="http://samsmith.io/">Sam Smith</a> use IRCCloud during Wikimania, I made the plunge and paid for IRCCloud. It is still connecting to my bouncer, so I have logs under my control. It also has a very usable Android client, and syncs ‘read’ status across devices, and is quite fast.</p>
<p>Convenience and UX won over ‘Free Software’ this time.</p>

      <p>I’ve started the habit of opening up a devlog post each morning and just filling it up as I go along. Let’s hope I can keep this up :)</p>
<ul>
<li>Merged a couple of Android patches. The app is getting better every day without too much involvement from me, and yay for that :) I’ve gotten closure over the Android app – it was fucking terrible, and now it is quite awesome. Need to write another post about that.</li>
<li>Fixed annoying bug with mysql connections being reset in Quarry’s query runners after a few hours. I had fixed this earlier when I was using <code>pymysql</code> directly with reconnect(ping=True), and assumed that switching to <a href="http://www.sqlalchemy.org/">SQLAlchemy</a> would’ve fixed it for me automagically. <a href="http://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/latest/faq.html#mysql-server-has-gone-away">Apparently not</a>. MySQL Y U SO BAD?</li>
<li>I have <code>sudo</code> access on <code>labmon1001</code> in prod! First Wikimedia production cluster machine I have root on, and will spend time over the next few weeks setting it up to run graphite. Should be fun!</li>
<li>Getting slightly better at packaging python things. Packaged <a href="https://github.com/sidnei/txstatsd">python-txstatsd</a> with no lintian errors, and only a couple warnings :)</li>
