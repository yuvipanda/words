  <p>SumaStorm was my desktop computer. She died a slow, silent and agonizing death over the past few months, which came to light only today. Due to my neglect, she is dead today.</p>

<p>I built SumStorm with my own hands, bought with my own money (thanks to several amazing people on the web) when I was 16 or so. It felt amazing when I first booted it up. It felt amazing when I maxed out all its cores running distcc with my netbook. It felt amazing that I could run Photoshop in a Win7 VM on Ubuntu and not feel a stutter.</p>

<p>It was an amazing machine.</p>

<p>I felt horrible when I realized the extent of the damage the rats had done. This must be how kid feel when the pet dog they grew up with dies. When run over by a tank. Which the kid was driving.</p>

<p>I did not know I could be this attached to a machine. It turned out to be a very emotional few hours.</p>

<p>RIP SumaStorm. I&#8217;m sorry.</p>

<p>THIS IS SO COOL!</p>

<p>I am now editing this blog post from my new Nexus 7.</p>

<p>THIS IS SO COOL!</p>

<p>I am a few years behind the curve on this. Last year was spent slogging my ass out at a wonderful startup and travelling to a lot of places meeting and working with some wonderful people. Left very little time for staying on the bleeding edge.</p>

<p>Changing that fast &#8211; trying to produce useful stuff while also staying close to the bleeding edge. Fun times ahead :-)</p>

  <p>Earlier this month I spent a couple of days as a &#8216;guest&#8217; at Infosys Mahindra City (district finals for <a href="http://campusconnect.infosys.com/Aspirations/">Aspirations 2020</a> &#8211; a TopCoder style programming competition). Interesting experience.</p>

<p>No laptops allowed. No storage devices either. Cameras are okay, but &#8220;<em>please don&#8217;t take pictures&#8221;</em>. Phones are okay too. The usual complimentary grope as you enter. Random security guards ask &#8220;<em>Where is your ID card?&#8221;</em> at random times. Buses bringing in hordes of people. Couples being couply in food courts. Reasonably good food. Formal clothes, without regard to the weather.  Everyone smiles when talking (unless they&#8217;re security guards). Respectful deference to hierarchical authority (with a big smile &amp; explicit announcements of gratefulness). Unlocked cycles to travel around the campus.</p>

<p>A vague sense of order, but no sense of purpose.</p>

<p>This is what people are trying to (and mostly succeeding) in making Engineering &#8216;education&#8217; resemble. If you&#8217;ve made peace with how engineering colleges are, you&#8217;ll feel completely at home at Infosys. Accident?</p>

  <p>You increase the time from 1.5 hours to 3 hours and give them another chance, of course!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Keeping in mind the welfare of children and the need for teachers to fill vacancies, the government directed TRB to conduct re-examination for candidates who failed to obtain 60 per cent marks.</p>

<p>The government has directed TRB to increase the duration of the test time from one-and-a-half hours to three hours with additional 30 minutes for blind candidates.</p>

<p>What wonderful concern for the future of our country/humanity. I also wonder if there is such a test for College Lecturers, and how the pass percentage for that would be.</p>

<p><strong>Update: </strong>Teachers now protesting against &#8216;difficulty&#8217; of test, <a href="http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2012-07-21/news/32776209_1_grace-marks-tet-teachers-eligibility-test">asking for &#8220;Grace Marks&#8221;</a>. Oh well.</p>

  <p>I&#8217;ve gotten rid of my Vim repo from GitHub, and switched to using <a href="https://github.com/gmarik/vundle">Vundle</a> + DropBox to keep my vim environment safely backed up.</p>

<p>You can find my <a href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/8768784/vimrc">.vimrc</a> file here. With just this and Vundle setup, I find it much easier to port my settings elsewhere instead of using git.</p>

<p>Hat tip to <a href="http://www.arunmozhi.in/">tecoholic</a> for pushing me to switch to Vundle :)</p>

  <p>When you&#8217;re proxying requests via nginx, you might assume after reading [the documentation][1] that every header is forwarded, except for the Host and Connection headers.</p>

<p>You&#8217;d also be wrong.</p>

<p>nginx <strong>drops</strong> all headers with an underscore in them.</p>

<p>This is a configurable settings. You can turn it on with a simple</p>

<pre>underscores_in_headers on</pre>

<p>I&#8217;m still baffled as to *why* this is <a href="http://wiki.nginx.org/HttpCoreModule#underscores_in_headers">a configuration parameter</a>. And why it is turned off by default. And why there is no mention of it in the proxy docs.</p>

<p>Thanks to <code>kolbyjack</code> on <code>#nginx</code> for helping me figure this out.</p>

  <p>Note: These are almost a decade old. Reproduced as close to memory as possible</p>

<p>My first memories of programming aren&#8217;t actually C. They were GW-BASIC, and later on, LOGO. I don&#8217;t remember any of my BASIC &#8211; but I do remember the look on my computer science teacher&#8217;s face in 5th grade when I managed to draw a flower with LOGO when everyone else was doing rectangles and lines. I vividly remember it &#8211; you draw an arc for a certain length, then stop, draw another arc in the reverse direction for the same length &#8211; and you have a petal. Then you just offset your next arc by a few degrees, repeat the previous thing, and you have another petal. Do this a few times such that <code>offset-degreese * count = 360</code> and you have a flower. That I could just modify the variables <code>length</code> and <code>offset-degree</code> to draw flowers as big, and with as many petals as you want &#8211; it blew my mind. This was in 5th grade &#8211; and I immediately started pestering my parents to put me in a programming language class outside (I had already gone to classes for _cough_MS Office<em>cough</em> and DOS back then). And the SSI nearby happened to be teaching a reasonably cheap <code>Unix/C/C++</code> class.</p>

<p>The first thing I remember still is someone telling me &#8220;you don&#8217;t need to type out clearscreen(); &#8211; clrscr() would do&#8221;. This was TurboC, and to me, at that point of time, a &#8216;good program&#8217; was one that had a <code>getch()</code> call at the end and a <code>clrscr()</code> in the beginning :)</p>

<p>The <code>Unix/C/C++</code> course &#8211; I don&#8217;t remember any Unix in it. And the C++ was disinteresting to me, because I saw no point in inheriting mammal from animal or car from vehicle. So I went about writing &#8216;C++&#8217;, which was basically C but with <code>cout</code> and <code>cin</code> instead of <code>printf()</code> and <code>scanf()</code> (I wouldn&#8217;t understand classes and how/why they were useful until I read <em>Hardcore Visual Basic 5</em> and saw the ways classes are useful and how much it sucks that VB doesn&#8217;t have them).</p>

<p>I had written a program called <code>DOSTutor</code> then (end of 5th grade, I guess?). It had screens and screens of text that &#8216;taught&#8217; you DOS commands, and then ones that made you type them in and &#8216;checked&#8217; it. Initially I had written it as a long series of <code>printf()</code> and <code>scanf()</code> statements. Suddenly some bulb went on and I realized I could cut my program size by about 90% if I separated code and data, and put the data (screen text and responses) into arrays. The feeling you get when you can reduce code drastically with no reduction in functionality (+ easier to make &#8216;fixes&#8217;) is quite incredible :)</p>

<p>But nobody ever used that program, so I wouldn&#8217;t consider that my first &#8216;program&#8217;. I spent the next year or so messing around with random <code>sound()</code> and <code>nosound()</code> calls producing &#8216;music&#8217; (including a few times when my code hit the <code>sound()</code> call, but crashed before the <code>nosound()</code> call &#8211; thus making the PC Speaker whine constantly, without any apparent way to turn it off. I used to just reset the computer then &#8211; until I learnt what exactly a <code>DOS System Call</code> meant. Then I wrote another small program that just called <code>nosound()</code>). I also remember messing around with BGI Graphics, mostly taking the example programs for <code>graphics.h</code> and modifying them to make somewhat-pretty figures.</p>

<p>My first &#8216;real&#8217; program was an implementation of a variant of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forms_of_cricket#Book_Cricket">Book Cricket</a>. It even had a stored High Scores file. It was my stint at a &#8216;programming center&#8217; (SSI, for those who remember), and I kept it in a Network Drive that I accessed using &#8216;Map Network Drive&#8217;. The amount of fun that was had when I discovered <code>rand()</code> was quite something. It even beeped when you got out!</p>

<p>I lost it all in a server crash. Just do &#8216;Map Network Drive&#8217; once and it was no longer there. I think I came home and cried :(</p>

<p>What was <em>your</em> first program?</p>
