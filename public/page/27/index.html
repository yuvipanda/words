      <p>Should I tell her?</p>
<p>I shouldn’t.</p>
<p>I don’t even know her. She’s new in class. So am I. We’re all new in this class. We are first years, at the first day of college.</p>
<p>I don’t even know her name! And she obviously doesn’t know my name. We are, for all intents and purposes, complete strangers in the same class.</p>
<p>What if she takes it seriously? I’ll probably be branded the classholic flirt of the class, and never be taken seriously ever again. I’ll be banned, and I can’t even use a sock puppet!</p>
<p>But, she doesn’t look like the type who take it seriously. Now, <em>that</em> girl over there? The type to take things seriously. I’d probably get a sternly worded letter from her dad if I so much looked at her. And a few broken bones if I tried talking. Meh.</p>
<p>But her. She doesn’t look anything like that at all. I could see her laughing with her nascent <em>friends</em>. Over some piece of silly joke probably. Or maybe a comment about some guy. Who knows! Just one of the things girls normally just laugh about and then say ‘what? nothing’ when you ask them about it later. There’s probably a term for that. ‘Sweet nothings?’ I don’t know. Ask a girl.</p>
<p>Maybe I should just go and tell her. It’s no big deal. It’s not like nobody ever does stuff like this. Yeah, it’ll be the first time for me, but heck! Everyone has a first time! I’ll probably get used to it.</p>
<p>Okay, I’ll just walk up to her, say “Hi”, and then say it. No big deal. If it works, it works. If it doesn’t, it doesn’t. Big deal!</p>
<p>I walked up to the gang of giggles. “Hey!”. I got an enthusiastic, sweet sounding “Hey!” back.</p>
<p>Wow, awesome voice! Now, not to lose composure. Just say it already goddarn it!</p>
<p>“Pretty dress you’ve got!”</p>
<p>“Awww cute! Thank you!”</p>
<p>Wow, that ‘omg squeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee’ voice again. Seriously? It’s almost like speaking to a grown up kid! But I’ve got to say it!</p>
<p>“Just the dress”</p>
<p>(<em>And thus began the most vile, spineless, soulless part of his life. And NO, you do not want to know how it ended</em>)</p>
<p>(<em>All parts of this story are complete, utter, crappy attempts at fiction, ofcoruse!</em>)</p>

      <p>He was coding.</p>
<p>He was on a bus, and coding. He had bought himself a cute little black Netbook just so he could open up Vim on a bus and code Python. He is a geek. A young, 18 year old typical geek. As typical as your usual geek.</p>
<p>The bus was quite empty. It was late at night, this was proably the last bus for the day, and except the Driver &amp; Conductor, there were probably 4 people on the bus. Including our geek.</p>
<p>That was until she got in.</p>
<p>She was younger than him. And pretty. Not pretty as in a ‘OMG Dude that chick is HAWT!’ pretty, but pretty as in ‘Wow, isn’t she darn beautiful?’ pretty. She looked out of place in that shabby bus, alone at the late hour. Like someone had embedded a beautiful snippet of Python inside a messy tangle of Java written by an ex-VB developer who learnt programming in Turbo C.</p>
<p>He saw her. “Nice hair”, he thought. And went back to coding.</p>
<p>Five silent minutes went past.</p>
<p>“Wow, what a Vim user! In the wild!”</p>
<p>He was startled. He was ‘in the zone’, and when you’re the zone, everything outside your screen is just a blur. The blur slowly started sharpening itself.</p>
<p>He turned back. It was her.</p>
<p>“Huh?”</p>
<p>“Your editor? It’s Vim”</p>
<p>“Huh huh?”</p>
<p>“So you’re not a real programmer. <a href="http://www.xkcd.net/378/">Real programmers use emacs</a>“</p>
<p>“Eh?”</p>
<p>“And <a href="http://bit.ly/realprogrammerspython">real programmers don’t use Python</a> either. <a href="http://www.ericsink.com/entries/c_morse_code.html">We code in C</a>“</p>
<p>“Erm, wha? Huh?”</p>
<p>“Yes, C. And Emacs. Vim is for Wimps. You would probably run windows on that thing if you could’ve. You are a total waste of space”</p>
<p>“What the?”</p>
<p>She timed it to perfection. The bus stopped. She got down, blew him a kiss, and went on her merry way.</p>
<p>“Damn! She’s a programmer, a girl, my age, who does emacs vs vim, AND I DIDN’T GET HER NUMBER!”</p>
<p>(Partially inspired by <a href="http://xkcd.com/377/">this</a>. It first went off into a wild arc involving a Ruby script written to generate Python code <em>cough</em>, but then I decided against including that)</p>
<p>(And yes, obviously, comments welcome. <a href="http://novelrace.in">#novelrace</a> helped me get off my ass and start writing, so I’ll be producing crap for some time now. But still, call crap crap :) )</p>

      <p>I’m Yuvi. This is my second blog. My old one has been retired because, well, it’s old! It contained too much ranting. It has content from me since I was 14 – a lot of that is just plain stupid, and a few are even embarassingly inaccurate &amp; naive. You can still possibly checkout the <a href="http://blog.yuvisense.net">old blog</a> – if I manage to get the content back :)</p>
<p>This new blog will be about me. My Code. .NET. Python. Mono. Maybe some Linux, and perhaps Ruby. My College. Human Stupidity. Fun. My Life. My Pictures. Possibly my Stories. Ofcourse, stuff too short for this will be over at <a href="http://twitter.com/yuvipanda">my twitterstream</a> :)</p>
<h4 id="the-statbot">The Statbot</h4>
<p><a href="http://thestatbot.com">TheStatBot.com</a> is being retired.</p>
<p>I don’t have enough time on my hands to maintain that seperately. I originally wanted to develop StatBot as a brand of it’s own, but I now have no time on my hands to do so. I have an internship coming up (more details later), have another one slated to start in 3 months, and hell just turned down one more! And ofcourse, there is <a href="http://busroutes.in">busroutes.in</a>, <a href="http://novelrace.in">novelrace.in</a>, and a bunch of other community sites I’m involved in, along with <a href="http://github.com/yuvipanda">my open source projects</a>.</p>
<p>And ofcourse, I have college life to attend to – and believe me, I’m having tons of fun. Yes, I do have a social life – I never thought I’ll have one till I joined this particular college. I hope to leave the college in a better state than when I entered it, and so am taking an active interest in developing it. And the management is awesome enough to let me help. So that takes up my time too!</p>
<p>I can honestly claim to not have the time to maintain the statbot brand :(</p>
<p>However, doesn’t mean I’m going to stop doing stats! I &lt;3 stats – I’ve just got a book from my (awesome) college library so I could start learning ‘proper’ statistics instead of just drawing graphs and looking for co-relations. And ofcourse, the code I use for stats (<a href="http://github.com/yuvipanda/goodfather">goodfather</a>, named after my awesome friend <a href="http://lagesse.org">Rob</a>) is also being actively developed, and is in it’s sixth (and possibly last) rewrite (maybe another blog post some other day about the number of rewrites).</p>
<p>Expect more stats posts. They’ll be on this blog too! I promise!</p>
<h4 id="blog-platform">Blog Platform</h4>
<p>This blog <em>runs</em> on <a href="http://github.com/yuvipanda/hislain">code</a> I personally wrote. The first piece of code that I’m using in a ‘production’ environment. I’m pumped! There will be bugs, and I will kill them. One.By.One :)</p>
<p>Okay, back to work now. More blog posts hopefully coming soon!</p>

  <div class="post-content">
      <p><a href="http://www.cforcoding.com/2009/06/do-programmers-optimize-life.html">Geeks Optimize Life</a>. True that. I do optimize the short route from when I get down from my college bus to my home, and me and <a href="http://sudarmuthu.com/blog">Sudar</a> did have an argument about optimization when we took the train together one day. My argument was that the distance you are going to walk is constant anyway (you either walk it at the station you are boarding the train, or where you are getting down), so moving to the extreme end of the train is pointless. He pointed out that if you walk when you are at the boarding station, you are using your <em>idle time</em> – time spent waiting for train to arrive (kinda like how the CPU can do stuff when waiting for IO to complete). However, time after you reach your destination is <em>not</em> idle time – you are not waiting for anything, so you should minimize the distance you have to walk before you can get out of the station and continue to whatever you have to do next. He was right, so I stfu :)</p>
<p>(Ofcourse, sometimes you want to actually <em>maximize</em> time spent walking – in that case, move to the wrong extreme end, and when (and if) asked, just act confused. Works :)</p>
<p>In the comments there, <a href="http://www.cforcoding.com/2009/06/do-programmers-optimize-life.html?showComment=1245689548116#c5549841120766090734">Rich</a> says that human social interaction/norms are so ineffecient we tend to optimize them out. However, I find that more often than not, it is not that human social interactions are ineffecient – they are just difficult to quantify. We sometimes mistake <code>undefined</code> for <code>zero</code>, and optimize it out. We shouldn’t. Converting <code>null</code> to <code>zero</code> is stupid. I hope I can stop doing that.</p>
