      <p>I’ve gotten rid of my Vim repo from GitHub, and switched to using <a href="https://github.com/gmarik/vundle">Vundle</a> + DropBox to keep my vim environment safely backed up.</p>
<p>You can find my <a href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/8768784/vimrc">.vimrc</a> file here. With just this and Vundle setup, I find it much easier to port my settings elsewhere instead of using git.</p>

      <p>Note: These are almost a decade old. Reproduced as close to memory as possible</p>
<p>My first memories of programming aren’t actually C. They were GW-BASIC, and later on, LOGO. I don’t remember any of my BASIC – but I do remember the look on my computer science teacher’s face in 5th grade when I managed to draw a flower with LOGO when everyone else was doing rectangles and lines. I vividly remember it – you draw an arc for a certain length, then stop, draw another arc in the reverse direction for the same length – and you have a petal. Then you just offset your next arc by a few degrees, repeat the previous thing, and you have another petal. Do this a few times such that <code>offset-degreese * count = 360</code> and you have a flower. That I could just modify the variables <code>length</code> and <code>offset-degree</code> to draw flowers as big, and with as many petals as you want – it blew my mind. This was in 5th grade – and I immediately started pestering my parents to put me in a programming language class outside (I had already gone to classes for <em>cough_MS Office_cough</em> and DOS back then). And the SSI nearby happened to be teaching a reasonably cheap <code>Unix/C/C++</code> class.</p>
<p>The first thing I remember still is someone telling me “you don’t need to type out clearscreen(); – clrscr() would do”. This was TurboC, and to me, at that point of time, a ‘good program’ was one that had a <code>getch()</code> call at the end and a <code>clrscr()</code> in the beginning :)</p>
<p>The <code>Unix/C/C++</code> course – I don’t remember any Unix in it. And the C++ was disinteresting to me, because I saw no point in inheriting mammal from animal or car from vehicle. So I went about writing ‘C++’, which was basically C but with <code>cout</code> and <code>cin</code> instead of <code>printf()</code> and <code>scanf()</code> (I wouldn’t understand classes and how/why they were useful until I read <em>Hardcore Visual Basic 5</em> and saw the ways classes are useful and how much it sucks that VB doesn’t have them).</p>
<p>I had written a program called <code>DOSTutor</code> then (end of 5th grade, I guess?). It had screens and screens of text that ‘taught’ you DOS commands, and then ones that made you type them in and ‘checked’ it. Initially I had written it as a long series of <code>printf()</code> and <code>scanf()</code> statements. Suddenly some bulb went on and I realized I could cut my program size by about 90% if I separated code and data, and put the data (screen text and responses) into arrays. The feeling you get when you can reduce code drastically with no reduction in functionality (+ easier to make ‘fixes’) is quite incredible :)</p>
<p>But nobody ever used that program, so I wouldn’t consider that my first ‘program’. I spent the next year or so messing around with random <code>sound()</code> and <code>nosound()</code> calls producing ‘music’ (including a few times when my code hit the <code>sound()</code> call, but crashed before the <code>nosound()</code> call – thus making the PC Speaker whine constantly, without any apparent way to turn it off. I used to just reset the computer then – until I learnt what exactly a <code>DOS System Call</code> meant. Then I wrote another small program that just called <code>nosound()</code>). I also remember messing around with BGI Graphics, mostly taking the example programs for <code>graphics.h</code> and modifying them to make somewhat-pretty figures.</p>
<p>My first ‘real’ program was an implementation of a variant of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forms_of_cricket#Book_Cricket">Book Cricket</a>. It even had a stored High Scores file. It was my stint at a ‘programming center’ (SSI, for those who remember), and I kept it in a Network Drive that I accessed using ‘Map Network Drive’. The amount of fun that was had when I discovered <code>rand()</code> was quite something. It even beeped when you got out!</p>
<p>I lost it all in a server crash. Just do ‘Map Network Drive’ once and it was no longer there. I think I came home and cried :(</p>
<p>What was <em>your</em> first program?</p>

Keep blog where it is (with the awesome <a href="http://webfaction.com">webfaction</a> people!) and use <a href="http://nginx.org">nginx</a> to proxy requests to blog/. Seems to work, so yay!</li>
<li>Rewrote tawp.in to use python/flask/memcached. Available on github. Replaced older node.js version</li>
<li>Reading through <em>The Art of Unix Programming</em> on kindle. Amazing book so far.</li>
<li>Fixed a few more bugs on Wikipedia App. I think I’ll keep ‘official’ Wiki related stuff off this, unless it’s big?</li>
<li>Partied along new year’s. Yay. Not particularly ‘dev’, but still :)</li>

<li>Incorporated search results (rather than just suggestions) into the Wikipedia app. Was a slight bitch to get right, but after that have made a bunch of variants that the others are testing out to see which one feels good (Suggestion if exists, else search, or search alone). Took up most of my time.</li>

<li>livetrains work. Trying to move (minimal) build system to waf. Somewhat complicated, not as fluid as I’d like. Go to rake. Feel weird about starting from scratch, come back to waf. Not get anything done Another rake diversion. Final Makefile editing desperation. I give up – I need to spend atleast a day to get back on proper build tools. That day is not today.</li>
<li>Added feature to change font size to wikipedia app. That took almost a couple of days and ended up being less than 20 lines of code. First was trying to enable pinch and zoom, but only for an iframe – proved impossible. And then a long time of headwalling about how I’m not able to manipulate the DOM inside the iframe (despite code in other places being able to do it just fine (no crossdomain issues here)), I had given up and moved elsewhere. Finally brion suggested I try inserting a <!-- raw HTML omitted --> into <!-- raw HTML omitted -->, which actually did work. So much for the browser being sane</li>
<li>‘Refined’ the search behavior of the wikipedia app a bit more. Also got bit by a difference between zepto (that we use) and jQuery (whose docs I have to read, since zepto by itself seems to have no docs). Had to read through the code to fix it, and managed to.</li>
<li>Closed a *lot* of bugs. BOY THAT FEELS GREAT!</li>
