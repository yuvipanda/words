      <p><strong>Note</strong>: I’m not an expert on Vala, GTK+, or anything else for that matter. If I am off base someplace, comment.</p>
<p>I spent quite a some time today trying to get GTKBuilder to automagically connect all my signals to their handlers. I tripped up at a few places, and so recording them here for posterity.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>If you are using instance methods (like most of us are), you’ve to decorate your handler function with the attribute <code>[CCode (instance_pos=-1)]</code>. This makes sure that the function is passed the <code>this</code> pointer as last argument, rather than first. You’ve to do this because <code>Builder.connect_signals</code> passes the instance as last parameter (<code>user_data</code>), and by aligning your <code>this</code> pointer with <code>user_data</code>, you make sure the correct instance is called.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Make sure your handler function signature matches what is expected. Ignore the <code>user_data</code> parameter of most signals – it is used internally by <code>Builder.connect_signals</code> (see above point).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Make sure you pass <code>--pkg gmodule-2.0</code> to your <code>valac</code>. If you’re using Autotools, this means you pass it to <code>VALAFLAGS</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>sure your C compiler is called with <code>-dynamic-export</code>. I’m told this enabled support for <code>dlopen</code> in the binary produced.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mangle your names properly. <code>Cheese.MainWindow.on_quit()</code> becomes <code>cheese_main_window_on_quit</code> on C, and that is what GTKBuilder expects. If you are not sure how your function name is mangled by <code>valac</code>, checkout the generated <code>.c</code> file.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>If you do all these 5 things right and you’re still having trouble, turn up on #vala at irc.gimp.net and ask the helpful folks there :)</p>

I’ll be making a blog post for each item ticked off that list, to share what I’ve learnt in my journey from n00b to someone whose code is good enough to be included in GNOME. This is part 1 in the series, where I tell you about autotools</em></p>
<p>My GSoC project involves, moving major parts (UI) of Cheese to a new language – <a href="http://live.gnome.org/Vala">Vala</a>. Vala is more an extremely glorious C preprocessor than a language of its own – it just translates down to GObject based C code, rather than bytecode/objectcode. The syntax is very C#ish – I was using <a href="http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/CSharpMode">csharp-mode</a> in emacs to code vala till I got bored enough to download <a href="http://live.gnome.org/Vala/Emacs">vala-mode</a>. It’s got closures – haven’t used them yet, here is to hoping they’re real closures. It has <em>tons</em> of libraries – it takes a few (minutes|hours) to write a binding for any C library, so many bindings already exist. You don’t lose speed – Vala is compiled down to C code. It also has one of Java’s suckiest features – <em>Checked Exceptions</em>. The documentation is non existent – you’ve to pretty much read through the bindings, or the original C library’s documentation to get anything done. And not many people know such a language exists (<a href="http://kausikram.net/">Kausik</a> for example – but he also didn’t know you could output pdf from latex, so I don’t think his opinion counts :D)</p>
<p>Cheese uses autotools for building. I had to tweak their script to make it build my Vala code as well. I’ve never worked with any of the autotools stuff before – I didn’t even know <code>.ac</code> stood for <code>autoconf</code> and <code>.am</code> stood for automake. No big deal – Google knows it all and will tell you for free. I JFGI and found a bunch of articles about using autotools to successfully build vala projects. After reading <a href="http://www.lrde.epita.fr/~adl/autotools.html">this monstrous (180+ slides, but ~500 pages) Autotools presentation</a> (which is actually very, <em>very</em> good, btw), I had a working build script. It built my single <code>cheese.vala</code> file that did nothing but run a loop and wait to be terminated. It had a place where I could add more <code>.vala</code> files and they should (should) be included in the build. It was hackish, but like most hacks, it worked. <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2007/03/the-works-on-my-machine-certification-program.html">On My Machine</a>(tm).</p>
<p>Nowhere else. Turned out my script wasn’t working at all – just faking it to me. I had initially tested out <code>valac</code> (the vala compiler), which had produced a <code>.c</code> file. Since <code>make</code> was supposed to produce the same file, and it wasn’t stale (I hadn’t touched my <code>cheese.vala</code>), it just proceeded to compiling the <code>.c</code> files with <code>gcc</code>. The Vala part of the build script wasn’t being executed at all. Removing the <code>.c</code> file told me that my hackish script hadn’t worked at all.</p>
<p>After banging my head for a while to figure out <em>why</em> it wasn’t working, I finally landed up on the official autotools docs. Autotools had added <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/hello/manual/automake/Vala-Support.html">native vala support</a>. The hack I found was not necessary.</p>
<p><em>facepalm</em></p>
<p><strong>Moral of the Story</strong>: RTFM comes first, not JFGI.</p>
<p>Anyway, I rewrote the build script to be much more cleaner in a couple of minutes. And it worked.</p>
<p>Build systems are actually a lot of fun once you get the hang of it. A black screen with fast scrolling green text cryptic to everyone else but totally sensible to you is incredibly attractive, no? :)</p>

This is part 0 in the series, where I tell you what my project is all about and how <a href="http://projects.gnome.org/cheese">Cheese</a> is going to become awesomer.</em></p>
<p>So, what exactly does <a href="http://gist.github.com/356202">my proposal</a> mean for Cheese?</p>
<ol>
<li>Moving the UI to <a href="http://live.gnome.org/Vala">Vala</a> (from C)</li>
<li>Move display bits from <a href="http://www.gtk.org/">GTK+</a> to <a href="http://clutter-project.org/">clutter</a></li>
<li>Implement Live Preview to show people how applying an effect will look before applying it</li>
<li>Implement loadable effects so you aren’t stuck with just 12 preloaded effects.</li>
</ol>
<p>I’m told that the scope is kinda too big for 3 months – but I’m sure that with careful planning (hah!), around 40 hours of work a week (haha!), lots of time away from college (hahaha!) I can do this stuff :)</p>
<p>I’m keeping my code in a <a href="http://github.com/yuvipanda/cheese">github repo</a>, so watch that for code updates. And will be updating this blog at the completion of every milestone, so subscribe if you haven’t :)</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: My exams are still going on. Won’t be coding much till they end (May 19th).</p>

<p><a href="http://gist.github.com/356202">Link to my, uhm, <em>cheesy</em> proposal</a></p>
<h3 id="what-now">What Now?</h3>
<p>Getting accepted doesn’t mean shit. Actually finishing whatever I was supposed to within 3 months does mean <em>something</em> – especially since I’ve taken on quite a bit of stuff to do (Move to new language + 2 new features). I’m quite the n00b – first time I’ll be doing just <em>one</em> thing over 3 months. Will be setting up a way of monitoring progress (probably via set milestones) soon enough. Will keep this place posted :)</p>
<p>Also, say Hi to my mentor <a href="http://home.cs.tum.edu/~siegel/">daniel siegel</a>. Him and fellow cheese-dev <a href="http://blogs.gnome.org/fargiolas/">Flippio Argiolas</a>, who were extremely helpful in getting my proposal whipped into shape (It’s a gist, so you can see how it eveolved over time).</p>
<p>The Oscar acceptance style blog post will be turned in once the three months are over and the newer, improved Cheese is accepted as good enough :D</p>

<p>Building things for the fun of building them is hacking. And <a href="http://db.glug-bom.org/lug-authors/philip/docs/hackers-not-crackers.html">hacking is not illegally breaking into computers</a>.</p>
<p>I like hacking. I want to be a real hacker. I can’t call myself one yet.</p>
<p>I’m putting this up as a reminder to myself – about what is important and what isn’t. Here is to hoping I remember to say <em>No</em> more often. Here is to hoping that the next time I’m bored, I write something rather than idle on IRC. GSoC (a bigger post about it coming up) is helping – a lot.</p>
<p>I’ll do a monthly ‘things I’ve hacked on’ post, and see how many things turn up on that :)</p>

<p>Ah, PyCon India 2009. My first solo bit of travel outside Chennai. What fun it was :) Though it was almost 7 months ago, most of the memories are still fresh. Compare that to college, where I struggle to remember what happened last week…</p>
<p>Anyway, it was fun. I went off by bus with the rather interesting Anirudh – a profitable startupeer and someone I met when working with <a href="http://busroutes.in">Busroutes.in</a>. He has a finances related degree and his startup deals with (rather cool) car electronics. He was also a KDE contributor, and is a very interesting travel partner for reasons too numerous to mention here.</p>
<p>I spent some time at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lal_Bagh">Lalbagh</a>, roaming around by myself (and texting classmates with my legs hanging off a cliff-type place). Was fun! I’d definitely do that again – the place was extremely peaceful.</p>
<p>I stayed at <a href="http://sudarmuthu.com">Sudar</a>‘s place. Staying at a bachelor’s place was fun – guess that was how my room would look like if I was left all to myself. It was, however, definitely too organized for my tastes – you could actually walk without accidentally stepping on stuff ;) He’s grown up too fast – he actually dragged me to a food place and forced me to have breakfast!</p>
<p>Hung around mostly with mech-yet-wannabe-geek <a href="http://kausikram.net">Kausik</a> (who once famously said that he ‘doesn’t want to use LaTeX for resumes because most people ask for docx or pdf’), Anirudh and Sudar (who was there only for Day 1). Had a longish talk with <a href="http://lawgon.livejournal.com/">Kenneth</a>, who I later found out was quite a celebrity on IRC/Mailing Lists. Meeting people you knew onlyine online IRL is unsettling at first.</p>
<p>The event itself went well. I was inside only for a couple of major talks – the one about waffle by <a href="http://twitter.com/cnu">cnu</a> is the only thing I could remember. I was mostly out in the corridors, typing out code in (one of the many) laptops that Sudar has. The lightning talks were way more fun – because they were only 15 mins or so long and packed a lot of tech (I particularly remember the one about Python internals by <a href="http://artagnon.com/">artagnon</a> and one about a GAE app by <a href="http://blog.ideamonk.in/">ideamonk</a>. I gave one too – the last one, so I had no projector, no working laptop, no mic, oh and Kausik who was supposed to present with me ditched me in the last minute :P It still went exceedingly well – it was my first time ever talking on a stage of any stage outside college and the practice I had from giving them in college (Thanks to <a href="http://dorai.wordpress.com/">Dorai</a> and the iCell) helped a ton. I even cracked quite a few jokes that was recieved well. Fun times – and I guess it finally killed the last remaining bits of my ‘shit, you aren’t really expecting me to go up there and talk, are you?’ feelings developed from school days :)</p>
<p>Before I left, I visited <a href="http://bitterscotch.wordpress.com/">planemad</a> at <a href="http://bangalore.nid.edu/">NID</a>. Awesome place. Someday, I hope someone established a National Institude of Programming at such a scenic place, where people can come together and learn about <em>programming</em> rather than <em>engineering</em> (which is just college-management-speak for <em>IT Industry Zombie Production Factory</em>)</p>
<p>There you go! That’s a rambling account of my PyCon India 2009 experiences. Next one is probably going to be in Chennai – looking forward to that!</p>

<p>Review: I’m going to save that when my free one year plan expires, I can <em>upgrade</em> to one of their better plans. It is <em>so</em> good :)</p>
<p>Highly Reccomended!</p>
