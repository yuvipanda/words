<h3 id="27-jan">27 Jan</h3>
<p>More of nothing productive. 32HourStartup is eating into my dev time.</p>
<h3 id="26-jan">26 Jan</h3>
<p>Nothing productive. Ugh. 32hourstartup website.</p>
<h3 id="25-jan">25 Jan</h3>
<p>Nothing productive. 32hourstartup website finally properly done.</p>
<h3 id="24-jan">24 Jan</h3>
<p>PiTiVi can now record audio into proper temp files, and insert them into the sources list when done. Also have a neat, complicated looking (:() VUMeter integrated.</p>
<p>Worked on the 32hourstartup website. Deployment is a bitch.</p>
<p>Couldn’t sleep. Woke up, fixed site. Fucking slow.</p>
<h3 id="23-jan">23 Jan</h3>
<p>Not much code. Worked on 32 Hour Startup website. Read more clojure books.</p>
<h3 id="22-jan">22 Jan</h3>
<p>Attended Geekweekend. Was fun. I’m now gonna learn myself some clojure. Setup a clojure dev environment. Trying to kill my JVM Biases.</p>
<h3 id="21-jan">21 Jan</h3>
<p>Read more PiTiVi code. Refactored the audiorecord bits off. Registered and put up a landing page on 32hourstartup.com</p>
<h3 id="20-jan">20 Jan</h3>
<p>Did nothing today. Read parts of PiTiVi code. Built up my ohloh profile a bit more. That is it. Sad</p>
<h3 id="19-jan">19 Jan</h3>
<h4 id="busroutesin-wiki">Busroutes.in wiki</h4>
<p>Nothing major got done. Unable to figure out easy way to start out on chennai (the center and zoom properties don’t seem to work – maybe parser caching?). Need to spend more time on this</p>
<h4 id="pitivi">PiTiVi</h4>
<p>Finally settled on a UI that both me and @nekohayo liked (‘inspired’ in no small way by iMovie :P). Should start working on the actual implementation now. Sent first email to the FSF folks with some semblance of ‘work done’. Feels good.</p>
<h4 id="misc-sysadmin-stuff">Misc Sysadmin Stuff</h4>
<p>Setup server for Mohan.</p>
<h3 id="18-jan">18 Jan</h3>
<h4 id="busroutesin-wiki-1">Busroutes.in Wiki</h4>
<p>Got Semantic Forms to work with Map input. Pulled in @kidbees (Bala) who did most of the Train routes entry. Templatized ‘Type’ for host. Need to find easier way to geocode.</p>
<h4 id="pitivi-1">PiTiVi</h4>
<p>Preliminary UI work/discussion with the PiTiVi guys. The dialog box approach didn’t quite work out, so we’re now moving to something more elegant and simplistic. It’s fun working with a responsive community (@nekohayo)</p>
<h3 id="12-17-jan">12-17 Jan</h3>
<h4 id="busroutesin-wiki-2">Busroutes.in Wiki</h4>
<p><a href="http://wiki.busroutes.in">http://wiki.busroutes.in</a> is up and running, thanks to AWS Free and @logic’s credit card. Semantic Mediawiki and a few extensions on. Getting to work figuring out all the templates and the extensions that turn SMW into something rather close to a programming language (It has conditionals! And templates can really be thought of as retarded functions). Started adding MRTS data – aim to complete Chennai Suburban Rails too fully and expose that data.</p>
<h4 id="tamilbeatcom-script">Tamilbeat.com Script</h4>
<p>Simple python script that scraped Tamilbeat.com, located all songs for all movies and spat out a shell script that used wget to download them into properly organized folders. The script also used <code>eyeD3</code> to set artist information on the songs. The script produced was incredibly dirty (no error checking, <strong>HUGE</strong> <em>fuck you</em> to ‘seperation of code and data’) – but worked wonderfully. Too wonderfully infact – I quickly used up 20G of my 25G allowance per month of usage, and it shows no sign of quitting. Will re run once I cross 25G.</p>
<p>The template output method was neat (template contained in .py file as triple quoted string, jinja2 template). Should rework it to seperate code and data.</p>
<h4 id="cheese">Cheese</h4>
<p>Planning on helping out with the port to gtk3. Spent good few hours on 17th setting up a gtk3 env (no jhbuild, uses –prefix and a custom activate script). Maybe I should try and learn how to use jhbuild – but my experience (and that of others in general) seems to be one of pain. Maybe next time I need to setup something custom.</p>
<h4 id="work-that-needed-to-be-done-but-not-done">Work that needed to be done, but not done</h4>
<p>PiTiVi. I’ll give it more love next week.</p>
<p>The Backup Thingy. I <em>do</em> need to do this. But when?</p>
<p>Personal Domains. Ugh.</p>
<h4 id="misc-sysadmin-stuff-1">Misc. Sysadmin stuff</h4>
<ul>
<li>Setup SSN’s Lakshya website on my server (webfaction). I personally found <a href="http://ssnlakshya.cloud10.in">http://ssnlakshya.cloud10.in</a> hilarious ;)</li>
<li>Setup PHP for Sriram on pirayalpha. Need to setup wsgi for him. Also gave him ownership of his nginx conf file, so he can actually do edits – but I’ve to be around to restart it. Proved a good decision, as he accidentally left out a } the first time he edited anything and bought the server to a halt. He’s incredibly remarkable for a 12 year old.</li>
<li>Tried upgrading my system to Natty. Botched. Main system getting more and more fucked by the day. Fresh install of Maverick, or is it finally time to move to Debian on my main system too?</li>

      <p>I was part of the team that organized <a href="http://nenfirstdot.in">NEN First Dot</a> – a student startup showcase. I was involved from day 0, so I was able to see it evolve from a high-in-the-sky concept to something that actually did happen. It was an incredible experience, to say the least.</p>
<h3 id="what-i-learnt">What I learnt</h3>
<p>I was the ‘tech’ guy – working with a few people (Karthik, Arun, Madhu, Dinesh, etc) to take care of most things tech. The entire team that organized this was rather huge – and I was pretty much interacting with them all the time. This was the first time I felt “part of something larger than myself” – part of a large Team for real. It was an incredible learning experience, to say the least.</p>
<p>Here is a partial list, written a few weeks after the event ended. By no means complete.</p>
<ul>
<li>“A small group of dedicated individuals will always be able to bring about large amount of changes”</li>
<li>When you see your <em>boss</em> work on till 3 AM, then get up at 6 AM to get back to work – it almost fills you with a sense of pride just to work with someone like that. I’ll be damned if I let myself slack off! This is incredibly important – it’s hard to respect someone who asks you to work when he is <em>busy</em> playing poker &amp; partying all the time.</li>
<li>Your team is incredibly important. Dedication matters more than talent. Who isn’t part of your team is almost as important as who is.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=flake">Flaking</a> is what marks you as unreliable and childish – and it’s very hard to shake that kinda reputation off.</li>
<li>Assigning blame is absolutely pointless. And counterproductive.</li>
<li>Email is an <em>incredibly</em> shitty way to be the sole medium of communication when organizing anything. We should’ve tried something like Basecamp. Our mailing list degenerated into unusable levels well before the event – most stuff was done via private mails with millions of people CCed – resulting in knowledge gaps and why-was-I-not-CCed-syndrome. A lot of money is there for the guys who figure out how to replace email in this context.</li>
<li>JFDI is incredible underrated.</li>
<li><a href="http://nenonline.org">NEN</a> is doing an incredible job of what the education system is supposed to be doing – making men out of boys (and women out of girls).</li>
<li>The social landscape is rather very diverse – and major parts of it are still absolutely unexplored from my POV. While at a much better position now than I was 3 years ago, I’ll still file this <code>bug</code> as <code>#needinfo</code></li>
<li>MBAs aren’t all useless. Some of the time. There – I said it.</li>
<li>Being in a college which doesn’t impose incredibly stupid rules frees up your mind to be worried about other things that might matter at some point (or not), rather than things that absolutely do not matter at all, in any universe. For example, you don’t have to worry about being <em>caught</em> and treated as a criminal for wearing a shirt with Two Pockets.</li>
<li>Don’t judge people. Don’t jump to conclusions. The world isn’t deterministic.</li>
<li>If you trust people, and give them responsibility <em>and</em> authority, they will often surprise you with the amount of work they are willing to put in. Don’t underestimate people.</li>
<li>You can’t hold yourself responsible for other people’s actions.</li>
</ul>
<p>I could probably expand each of these points into a post on their own – and maybe I will someday :) This post, however, should make sure I don’t forget much of these next time around!</p>

      <p><em>[Note: I’ve a rather large backlog of blog posts to do, will push them out as soon as I can]</em></p>
<p>Saturday (22 Jan 2011) was spent at <a href="http://www.geekweekend.in/index.html">Geekweekend</a>, organized at <a href="http://www.thoughtworks.com/other-offices">Thougtworks Chennai</a>. The event had awesomeness written all over it, even before it started – how can <em>any</em> event where you register through a (rather limited, but still) command line interface on a website be not good? :D</p>
<p>I was late as usual (damn living so far away from everywhere) – and found my way walking through the underbelly of the Kathipara junction thanks to <a href="http://maps.google.co.in">Google Maps’ Walking Directions</a> :P</p>
<h2 id="clojure">Clojure</h2>
<p>Missed the first session. Turned up for the clojure session – it was good. I’ve been meaning to learn one of the OMGPARANTHESES langueages, and from the tooling/library support – clojure seems to be the way to go. Spent time during the talk setting up my machine to do clojure dev (took forever to setup – it is a netbook, afterall). Wanted to build something small before the end of the event (like a URL Shortener!) but too late for that.</p>
<p>I do plan on writing something with clojure in the short term though. Looking for ideas.</p>
<h2 id="lunch">Lunch</h2>
<p>Lunch. Met the usual group of geeks around. Fun, as usual :D Lunch was excellent. Me and <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/sup3rkiddo">Superkiddo</a> continued the tradition of stealing sweets from <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/justjkk">Kishore</a>‘s plate :D</p>
<h2 id="monads">Monads</h2>
<p>Then came the session on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monad_(functional_programming)">Monads</a>. I still don’t understand them. But that’s okay – the discussion was rather intellectually stimulating. It also reminded me that my mathematical/theoretical-cs foundation is incredibly weak (by geek standards) and needs updating/pushing up. Should start on <a href="http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/">SICP</a> (<em>again</em>).</p>
<h2 id="purely-functional-languages-on-the-fringe">Purely Functional Languages on the fringe</h2>
<p>The discussions were the most fun, productive part of the day, IMO. Most people who weren’t fully interested had already left – so the self-selected crowd was rather intense. Nobody there was actually using any purely functional language in production – which was expected. My opinion is that <em>purely</em> functional languages will always be on the fringe – as they should be. But features from them will trickle in slowly into mainstream, <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/avg.html">blub</a> programming languages (even PHP <a href="http://php.net/manual/en/functions.anonymous.php">has lambdas</a> now!). Learning to think in a functional way will expand your mind, and make you a better programmer – even if you’re not programming in a purely functional language.</p>
<h2 id="my-irrational-hate-for-java">My Irrational Hate for Java</h2>
<p>I’m not sure from where — perhaps the fucked up Java GUI apps, or my early stage semicolon/case-sensitivity hate (hey, I was 14, what do you expect!) or the fact that Java the language is way too verbose — I’ve had an irrational <strong>hate</strong> of all things Java/JVM. But that’s just that – irrational. So I’m taking a concerted effort to learn myself some JVM – hence clojure. I still don’t like Java the language (C# FTW!) – but the tools and libraries around JVM seem to be pretty good. Let’s see how this experiment at de-biasing turns out!</p>
<h2 id="functional-programming-users-group">Functional Programming Users group</h2>
<p>The idea of a Functional Language Users group was floated around. Waiting for it to turn up!</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: <a href="http://fpug-c.posterous.com/#!/">Here you go</a>. Join up and keep posting. I’m not sure how the idea of posterous groups will work out though.</p>
<h2 id="thoughtworks-8216crowd8217">Thoughtworks ‘crowd’</h2>
<p>I’ve generally found that events organized at Thoughworks/by Thoughtworkers have higher average audience quality than most other events. Thanks for putting together events guys :)</p>

      <p>This semester, one of our so called <em>electives</em> (despite the fact that we have no real choice in them) is Numerical Methods. I don’t quite like the actual way the subject is taught – mind numbing, error prone calculations with a calculator. However, the methods are pretty awesome.</p>
<p>The staff explained <a href="https://gist.github.com/753872">Gauss Seidel</a> yesterday, and it seemed a straightforward recursive solution to me. So in the break, I cooked up a small python <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gauss%E2%80%93Seidel_method">script</a> that gave me all the intermediate answers as well – so for any <em>assignments</em> I could just run them through this and copy it to paper.</p>
<p>What happened after that was more interesting. The staff made an offhand remark that she hates the subject, since it involves so much mindnumbingly repetitive calculative work, and not something fun like probability theory. I picked it up, and we had an interesting conversation that ended up with me showing her a 3-function version of the above code and explaining to her how I got this. She was incredibly interested – and asked me how to explain each line properly.</p>
<p>Was a lot of fun. Sad that this is the first time in 3 years that I’ve had someone who is actually interested in what they’re teaching, rather than treating it as just a normal 9-5 job not much different from herding sheep. What exactly can we do to change this?</p>

      <p>I moved to Vim from Emacs a while back. I realized I was not using emacs to its fullest extent – I was using it as ‘just a text editor’, and alt-tabbing to <code>gnome-terminal</code> for most of my work. I was using one tool per job anyway, so why not go all the way and use a <a href="http://www.vim.org/">text editor</a> for a text editor instead of <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/">yet another operating system</a> :P</p>
<p>Also, and perhaps more importantly – on my rather small <a href="http://yuvi.in/blog/samsung-n210-review.html">Netbook</a>, pressing combos felt awkward to me (I know it shouldn’t have, but it did). Much better (atleast so far) with vim than Emacs. Since most of my coding these days seems to be done on this small and underpowered machine, and my wrists were hurting anyway, I switched.</p>
<p>Muscle memory is still set to emacs (hit <code>C-k</code> several times when it should’ve been <code>d$</code>), but I guess I’ll eventually get back to being fast enough in vim :)</p>
<p>Last time I was on vim, I was just getting used to Linux, and switched to emacs a few months after. I wonder if I’ll switch again in the future.</p>
<p>TL;DR: Moved from Emacs to Vim ‘coz I felt like it.</p>

      <p>“Why does Cheese have a maximum photo count of 100 in burst mode?” questions have popped up quite a few times on the cheese list. It is just a teeny, tiny bug – fixed in master.</p>
<p>The work around is simple:</p>
<p><strong>Till Cheese 2.32</strong></p>
<p>Raise it to whatever value you want in <code>line 8</code> of <code>/usr/share/cheese/cheese-prefs.ui</code>.</p>
<p><em>(If you don’t know what version you are running, check <code>Help -&gt; About</code>)</em></p>
<p>(Fix is just raising the limit from 100 to something that most people will likely not hit. If they do hit it – well, <code>line 40 on /usr/share/cheese/cheese-prefs.ui</code> :D)</p>

      <p>I posted a while back that I <a href="http://yuvi.in/blog/running-archlinux.html">moved</a> to Arch (from Ubuntu) on my Netbook. That was almost two months back. My Arch experiment, sadly, didn’t work out for long. I moved back to Ubuntu within a couple of week’s time. Why?</p>
<ol>
<li>Lack of binary packages. I had to build quite a few packages from source because there were no binary packages available. The tilting point was when I figured there were no binary packges for mit-scheme! Ofcourse, I could’ve just used AUR and built them from source, but…</li>
<li>Building from source on my Netbook sucks. ATOM + Slow Hard Drive -&gt; I’m nuts waiting for stuff to compile. The AUR is basically useless to me.</li>
</ol>
<p>Hello Ubuntu! (I also hate Unity ‘coz it takes up precious screen space – might move to something else soon)</p>
<p>TL;DR: Arch doesn’t have enough binary packages and building on a netbook sucks</p>

      <p>I, along with about a 100 other classmates of mine, went on an <em>Industrial Visit</em> to Kerala a few weeks back. It was a 3 day, 4 night affair – and was incredibly fun and refreshing. New friendships were forged, old ones rekindled, temptations resisted, a thousand pictures clicked (thanks to @RohitP’s camera), group dynamics studied and incredible fun had. It was very refreshing (for the most part), and I realized just why vacations are important.</p>
<p>I plan on visiting [Athrapalli Falls][afalls] again as soon as I possibly can. Being in fast moving, (relatively) cold water is an incredibly experience I’m glad I didn’t miss. You shouldn’t either.</p>
