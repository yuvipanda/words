      <p>For those of you who didn’t know, <a href="http://github.com/bickfordb/waffle">Waffle</a> is a <a href="http://bret.appspot.com/entry/how-friendfeed-uses-mysql">schemaless storage layer</a> that sits on top of SQLAlchemy. Something that I was initially very interested in.</p>
<p>Not anymore.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Because I found <a href="http://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/Home">MongoDB</a>.</p>
<p>And fell in love.</p>
<p>Yes, I do know they both are different, but MongoDB has the things that attracted me to Waffle (very flexible schema, great querying, indexes) and is just as easy to set up (maybe not as easy as Waffle over SQLite, but only slightly less easier).</p>
<p>I &lt;3 MongoDB. Let’s see how long this lasts!</p>

      <p>I was about to just type a list of stuff here, but that doesn’t do the topic justice. So here I am, at 3:30 in the morning, sleep cycle screwed up by the Hackfest, typing out a post on what all I learnt from there. I spent pretty much my entire awake-time at the IIT, so it helped me a lot.</p>
<h4 id="your-college-doesn8217t-matter-much">Your college doesn’t matter much</h4>
<p>IIT Envy. Every non-IITian has that. I spent a lot of time at IITM during the Hackfest, and while my IITEnvy did go up during the first few hours, it initially came down well below normal as I got to know the people better. What was cool about them was not <em>where they were studying</em>, but <em>what they were doing</em>. I could do what these guys were doing. Anyone can do what these guys were doing – there is nothing special about the IIT except maybe for the fact that it aggregates naturally dedicated people into pools. You don’t need an IIT for that – IRC will do :) I’m from a teeny college that nobody has heard of – that would have been a problem when people judged people by where they studied, rather than by what they did. Should not be a problem for me now :)</p>
<h4 id="real-c-isn8217t-hard">Real C isn’t hard</h4>
<p>I was utterly clueless about GTK+ when I landed up at the IIT. The first thing I told <a href="http://arun.chagantys.org/blog/">Arun</a> was that I was clueless about C and maybe would like to hack on something in C# or Python.</p>
<p>I thought I was clueless about C. All I had done was TurboC – which I had not really considered as <em>real</em> C till that point. However, an hour into the hackfest, I realized something – Pointers and Structures are all you need! Read the docs, read some good code, and you are done. I will probably do what I usually do to learn a new language – write a significant amount of useful code in it – in C very soon.</p>
<h4 id="code-talks">Code talks</h4>
<p>I don’t have any patches against my name. The only significant piece of code I think I have written so far is this blogging engine you are reading. That needs to change.</p>
<p>Doesn’t mean I have to churn out code like a copier machine – I just have to have enough things to point to and be able to proudly say ‘I did that’. Great Documentation, proper deployment options and a little evangelism helps too. None of my code has any of that. That has to change too.</p>
<h4 id="know-tools-well">Know tools well</h4>
<p>I use Emacs. But not to its fullest potential. Same thing for pretty much all of my tools – Bash/Powershell, Build Tools, etc. Heck, I can’t even write a shell script to save my life! That has to change, and change fast. I smell perl.</p>
<h4 id="people-on-irc-are-friendly">People on IRC are friendly</h4>
<p>I’ve always been a lurker on IRC, just listening and not daring to speak. That changed <em>drastically</em> once I actually met these really nice people in person – so I can see my IRC usage going way up! It has also expanded my horizons quite a bit – meeting new people, getting to know people better, constantly being challenged to actually get off my ass and write some stuff, etc.</p>
<h4 id="todo">TODO</h4>
<ul>
<li>Read more code. File bugs. Try to fix bugs.</li>
<li>Learn Perl. Learn C. Learn C++. Get much better at Python.</li>
<li>Go through my <a href="http://github.com/yuvipanda">code</a>, document all the necessary parts, create home pages for the significant ones.</li>
<li>IRC more. I have been – the last two days have seen my IRC usage skyrocket.</li>
<li>Stop cribbing about my life and get on with it!</li>
</ul>

Will hopefully be a lot of fun – and may I be able to contribute my first ever patch during the event ;) Got permission to not get back home – but wondering, where would I stay? Probably pass out in front of the computers :)</p>
<p>I’ll be hackin on GNOME Apps – hopefully <a href="http://banshee-project.org/">Banshee</a> (since that’s one app I <strong>love</strong>), or write a newish, smallish app with PyGTK. Anything would do but :)</p>
<p>Will be blogging more – Sadly, no camera, so no pictures :(</p>

<li>Add support for raw, unmanaged pages</li>
<li>Port a decent looking, simple theme to HiSlain</li>

<li>WRITE MORE DOCUMENTATION!</li>
