  <p>It was exactly six years ago that I started blogging. <a href="http://yuvipanda.blogspot.com/2005/05/introduction.html">My first blog post</a> ow seems to be rather childish, but considering I was 14 then, maybe it is excusable :)</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve moved across several blogging platforms and urls in the meantime (<a href="http://yuvipanda.blogspot.com">Blogspot</a>, wordpress and now <a href="https://github.com/yuvipanda/hislain">my own custom engine</a>. I&#8217;ve sadly lost a good portion of my blogs thanks to a domain loss and a server crash. Sigh.</p>

<p>Also, looks like I&#8217;ve been writing code for almost eleven years now! Not counting my turboC years, that would be 8 years now. Not bad, eh? I&#8217;ve been coding for more than 60% of my life :)</p>
