<p>One of the (good) things that came out of the <a href="http://yuvi.in/blog/what-i-learnt-from-the-hackfest-at-iitm.html">IIT Hackfest</a> was me hanging out on the #hackers-india IRC channel. It is wild, swingy and usually fun. Usually.</p>

<p>So yesterday night, <a href="http://ideamonk.blogspot.com/">ideamonk</a> casually mentioned that he was working on something called <a href="http://github.com/yuvipanda/pymos">pymos</a>. It was a python script that made mosiacs. Now that was something I was totally interested in &#8211; I tried making a similar &#8216;script&#8217; a long time back (in C#), and totally utterly failed, simply because I was so caught up with the part that downloaded pictures from flickr that I didn&#8217;t do the part that generated the actual Mosaic. Since ideamonk&#8217;s code already generated the mosaics (and since it was in Python), I forked it, and began to work on the to do items.</p>

<p>Note that ideamonk and I don&#8217;t know each other (we were apparently sitting next to each other at PyCon India &#8217;09, but that doesn&#8217;t count!). We were on the channel, he&#8217;s commented on my blog once, and that&#8217;s about it. But still, we worked together all night fixing code. I could bore you with details of the work that was done within the next five or so hours (1 AM &#8211; 6 AM), but I will just point you to to this <a href="http://github.com/ideamonk/PyMos/network">commit graph</a> generated by GitHub. There was a flurry of commits, and there should be a tagged version up for download (and on PyPI) soon.</p>

<h4 id="if-not-for-github-8230">If not for github&#8230;</h4>

<p>Let us, for a moment, assume that this code was on, say, <a href="http://code.google.com">Google Code</a> instead of <a href="http://github.com">GitHub</a>. How could I have contributed?</p>

<ol>
<li>Checkout the code via SVN</li>
<li>Fix one thing</li>
<li>Send ideamonk a patch file (I can&#8217;t commit anything anywhere!)</li>

<li><p>Wait for him to:</p>

<p>4a. Open up his mail client</p>

<p>4ai. Get lost in <a href="http://programming.reddit.com">proggit</a> (or <a href="http://facebook.com">FaceBook</a>)</p>

<p>4b. Grab the patch file</p>

<p>4c. Apply patch</p>

<p>4d. Test things to make sure I didn&#8217;t break things</p>

<p>4e. Wonder if the code is good enough to be merged in</p>

<p>4f. Commit code with my patch in it</p>

<p>4g. Notify me that my patch is in, so i can do an svn up</p></li>

<li><p>Go to 2</p></li>
</ol>

<p>No code gets committed, simply because step 4 is a huge involvement for ideamonk. Knowing that step 4 is a huge involvement for ideamonk is a huge block for me too. Obviously, he&#8217;d rather be coding than dealing with patches. Who wouldn&#8217;t? Being a developer &gt; Being a maintainer. One of the reasons I respect maintainers of projects a lot.</p>

<p>Now, how does it work with github?</p>

<ol>
<li>I fork <a href="http://github.com/ideamonk/pymos">it</a> (1 click)</li>
<li>Fix one thing</li>
<li>Commit, Push to <a href="http://github.com/yuvipanda/pymos">my repo</a></li>
<li>If there is something significant in, notify ideamonk to pull from me. Else go to 2.</li>
</ol>

<p>Much simpler, and note that all four are things <strong>I could do myself</strong>. Nothing depends on ideamonk. Maintainence works is almost zero. Nobody has keys to the cathedral, since this is not one.</p>

<h4 id="please-put-your-code-on-github">Please put your code on GitHub</h4>

<p>It has the least amount of friction for developers looking to contribute, and the least amount of work for you as maintainer. Thanks!</p>
