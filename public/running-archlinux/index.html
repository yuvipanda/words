  <p>I&#8217;m blogging from Arch Linux :D</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve been meaning to setup Arch on <a href="http://yuvi.in/blog/samsung-n210-review.html">my netbook</a> for a while, after hearing a lot of people rave about how awesome <code>pacman</code> is and how fast their system is. I didn&#8217;t want to spend time on moving to a new distro during my GSoC, so I kept putting it off. Yesterday Ubuntu borked on my netbook for some weird reason (I suspect it was my friend Rathna sitting on it, but might have been because I was thinking of moving to Vim too) &#8211; and I took the opportunity to install Arch. After some messing around, and some help from #archlinux, I was able to get myself a commandline that also connected to the Internet via wifi. Yay!</p>

<p>I tried out <a href="http://lxde.org/">LXDE</a> first, instead of my usual <a href="http://www.gnome.org/">GNOME</a> &#8211; and found that it was incredibly unpolished (compared to GNOME). So after a bit of a struggle (AND READING DOCS! (and yes, my problem was dbus)), I got a minimal (very application-less) GNOME up and running. And yes, it is way faster. And yes, the packages are newer (and shinier!). And #archlinux was helpful :)</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve had to (understand and) edit a fair amount of config files to get myself a working system. It&#8217;s been a fun and informative journey &#8211; and I expect it will continue to be. My entire Linux experience so far has been with Ubuntu (hell, even the server I administer runs Ubuntu!), so coming to this world of required-and-encouraged config file editing is doing me good :)</p>

<p>I&#8217;m enjoying it :) If you&#8217;re a geek who loves fast text scrolling on an LCD (and you also have the time), you too would.</p>
