  <p>He was coding.</p>

<p>He was on a bus, and coding. He had bought himself a cute little black Netbook just so he could open up Vim on a bus and code Python. He is a geek. A young, 18 year old typical geek. As typical as your usual geek.</p>

<p>The bus was quite empty. It was late at night, this was proably the last bus for the day, and except the Driver &amp; Conductor, there were probably 4 people on the bus. Including our geek.</p>

<p>That was until she got in.</p>

<p>She was younger than him. And pretty. Not pretty as in a &#8216;OMG Dude that chick is HAWT!&#8217; pretty, but pretty as in &#8216;Wow, isn&#8217;t she darn beautiful?&#8217; pretty. She looked out of place in that shabby bus, alone at the late hour. Like someone had embedded a beautiful snippet of Python inside a messy tangle of Java written by an ex-VB developer who learnt programming in Turbo C.</p>

<p>He saw her. &#8220;Nice hair&#8221;, he thought. And went back to coding.</p>

<p>Five silent minutes went past.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wow, what a Vim user! In the wild!&#8221;</p>

<p>He was startled. He was &#8216;in the zone&#8217;, and when you&#8217;re the zone, everything outside your screen is just a blur. The blur slowly started sharpening itself.</p>

<p>He turned back. It was her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Huh?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Your editor? It&#8217;s Vim&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Huh huh?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So you&#8217;re not a real programmer. <a href="http://www.xkcd.net/378/">Real programmers use emacs</a>&#8220;</p>

<p>&#8220;Eh?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And <a href="http://bit.ly/realprogrammerspython">real programmers don&#8217;t use Python</a> either. <a href="http://www.ericsink.com/entries/c_morse_code.html">We code in C</a>&#8220;</p>

<p>&#8220;Erm, wha? Huh?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, C. And Emacs. Vim is for Wimps. You would probably run windows on that thing if you could&#8217;ve. You are a total waste of space&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What the?&#8221;</p>

<p>She timed it to perfection. The bus stopped. She got down, blew him a kiss, and went on her merry way.</p>

<p>&#8220;Damn! She&#8217;s a programmer, a girl, my age, who does emacs vs vim, AND I DIDN&#8217;T GET HER NUMBER!&#8221;</p>

<p>(Partially inspired by <a href="http://xkcd.com/377/">this</a>. It first went off into a wild arc involving a Ruby script written to generate Python code <em>cough</em>, but then I decided against including that)</p>

<p>(And yes, obviously, comments welcome. <a href="http://novelrace.in">#novelrace</a> helped me get off my ass and start writing, so I&#8217;ll be producing crap for some time now. But still, call crap crap :) )</p>
