<p>The wonderful <a href="https://twitter.com/GrahamDumpleton">Graham Dumpleton</a> asked <a href="https://twitter.com/GrahamDumpleton/status/936740552304836608">on twitter</a> why we built an entirely new tool (<a href="https://github.com/jupyter/repo2docker">repo2docker</a>) instead of using OpenShift&rsquo;s cool <a href="https://github.com/openshift/source-to-image">source2image</a> tool.</p>

<p>This is a very good question, and not a decision we made lightly. This post lays out some history, and explains the reasons we decided to stop using s2i. s2i is still a great tool for most production use cases, and you should use it if you&rsquo;re building anything like a PaaS!</p>

<h2 id="terminology">Terminology</h2>

<p>Before discussing, I want to clarify &amp; define the various projects we are talking about.</p>

<ol>
<li><a href="https://github.com/openshift/source-to-image">s2i</a> is a nice tool from the <a href="http://openshift.org/">OpenShift</a> project that is used to build images out of git repositories. You can use heroku-like buildpacks to specify how the image should be built. It&rsquo;s used in OpenShift, but can also be easily used standalone.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/jupyterhub/binderhub">BinderHub</a> is the UI + scheduling component of Binder. This is what you see when you go to <a href="https://mybinder.org">https://mybinder.org</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/jupyter/repo2docker">repo2docker</a> is a standalone python application that takes a git repository &amp; converts it into a docker image containing the environment that is specified in the repository. This heavily overlaps with functionality in s2i.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="when-repo2docker-just-wrapped-s2i">When repo2docker just wrapped s2i&hellip;</h2>

<p>When we started building <a href="https://github.com/jupyterhub/binderhub">BinderHub</a>, I looked around for a good heroku-like &lsquo;repository to container image&rsquo; builder project. I first looked at Deis&rsquo; <a href="https://github.com/deis/slugbuilder">slugbuilder</a> and <a href="https://github.com/deis/dockerbuilder">dockerbuilder</a> - they didn&rsquo;t quite match our needs, and seemed a bit tied into Deis. I then found OpenShift&rsquo;s <a href="https://github.com/openshift/source-to-image">source2image</a>, and was very happy! It worked pretty well standalone, and <code>#openshift</code> on IRC was very responsive.</p>

<p>So until July 1, we actually used s2i under the hood! <code>repo2docker</code> was a wrapper that performed the following functions:</p>

<ol>
<li>Detect which s2i buildpack to use for a given repository</li>
<li>Support building arbitrary Dockerfiles (s2i couldn&rsquo;t do this)</li>
<li>Support the Legacy Dockerfiles that were required under the old version of mybinder.org. The older version of mybinder.org munged these Dockerfiles, and so we needed to replicate that for compatibility.</li>
</ol>

<p>@minrk did some wonderful work in allowing us to package the s2i binary into our python package, so users didn&rsquo;t even need to download s2i separately. It worked great, and we were happy with it!</p>

<h2 id="moving-off-s2i">Moving off s2i</h2>

<p>Sometime in July, we started adding support for Julia to binder/repo2docker. This brought up an interesting &amp; vital issue - composability.</p>

<p>If a user had a <code>requirements.txt</code> in their repo <em>and</em> a <code>REQUIRE</code> file, then we&rsquo;d have to provide both a Python3 and Julia environment. To support this in s2i, we&rsquo;d have needed to make a <code>python3-julia</code> buildpack.</p>

<p>If it had a <code>requirements.txt</code>, a <code>runtime.txt</code> with contents <code>python-2.7</code> and a <code>REQUIRE</code> file, we&rsquo;d have to provide a Python3 environment, a Python2 environment, and a Julia environment. To support this in s2i, we&rsquo;d have needed to make a <code>python3-python2-julia</code> buildpack.</p>

<p>If it had an <code>environment.yml</code> file and a <code>REQUIRE</code> file, we&rsquo;d have to provide a conda environment and a Julia environment. To do this, we&rsquo;d have to make a <code>conda-julia</code> buildpack.</p>

<p>As we add support for other languages (such as R), we&rsquo;d need to keep expanding the set of buildpacks we had. It&rsquo;d become a combinatorial explosion of buildpacks. This isn&rsquo;t a requirement or a big deal for PaaS offerings - usually a container image should only contain one &lsquo;application&rsquo;, and those are usually built using only one language. If you use multiple languages, you just make them each into their own container &amp; communicate over the network. However, Binder was building images that contained <em>environments</em> that people could explore and do things in, rather than specific applications. Since a lot of scientific computing uses multiple languages (looking at you, the people who do everything in R but scrape using Python), this was a core feature / requirement for Binder. So we couldn&rsquo;t restrict people to single-language buildpacks.</p>

<p>So I decided that we can <em>generate</em> these combinatorial buildpacks in repo2docker. We can have a script that generates the buildpacks at build time, and then we can just check in the generated code. This would let us keep using s2i for doing image builds and pushes, and allow others using s2i to use our buildpacks. Win-win!</p>

<p>This had the following problems:</p>

<ol>
<li>I was generating bash from python. This was quite error prone, since the bash also needed to carefully support the various complex environment specifications we wanted to support.</li>
<li>We needed to <em>sometimes</em> run assemble scripts as root (such as when there is an &lsquo;apt.txt&rsquo; requiring package installs). This would require careful usage of <code>sudo</code> in the generated bash for security reasons.</li>
<li>This was very &lsquo;clever&rsquo; code, and after running into a few bugs here I was convinced this &lsquo;generate bash with python&rsquo; idea was too clever for us to use reliably.</li>
</ol>

<p>At this point I considered making the <code>assemble</code> script into Python, but then I&rsquo;d be either generating Python from Python, or basically writing a full library that will be invoked from inside each buildpack. We&rsquo;d still need to keep repo2docker around (for Dockerfile + Legacy Dockerfile support), and the s2i buildpacks will be quite complex. This would also affect Docker image layer caching, since all activities of <code>assemble</code> are cached as one layer. Since a lot of repositories have similar environments (or are just building successive versions of same repo), this gives up a good amount of caching.</p>

<p>So instead I decided that the right thing to do here is to dynamically generate a Dockerfile in python code, and build / push the image ourselves. S2I was great for generating a best-practices production container that runs one thing and does it well, but for binder we wanted to generate container images that captured complex environments without regard to what can run in them. Forcing s2i to do what we wanted seemed like trying to get a square peg into a round hole.</p>

<p>So in <a href="https://github.com/jupyter/repo2docker/commit/38755650c28fe6c71adec5a5bf9adfdde2d9772e">this heavily squashed commit</a> I removed s2i, and repo2docker became stand alone. It was sad, since I really would have liked to not write extra code &amp; keep leveraging s2i. But the code is cleaner, easier for people to understand and maintain, and the composing works pretty well in understandable ways after we removed it. So IMO it was the right thing to do!</p>

<p>I personally would be happy to go back to using s2i if we can find a clean way to support composability + caching there, but IMO that would make s2i too complex for its primary purpose of building images for a PaaS. I don&rsquo;t see repo2docker and s2i as competitors, as much as tools of similar types in different domains. Lots of &lt;3 to the s2i / openshift folks!</p>

<p>I hope this was a useful read!</p>

<h2 id="tldr">TLDR</h2>

<p>S2I was great for generating a best-practices production container that runs one thing and does it well, but for binder we wanted to generate container images that captured complex environments without regard to what can run in them. Forcing s2i to do what we wanted seemed like trying to get a square peg into a round hole.</p>

    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">Tue, Oct 10, 2017</span>

    <p>I was at <a href="http://maintainerati.org/">maintainerati</a> today, which was super fun &amp; quite intense! I highly appreciate GitHub &amp; the individuals involved in making it happen!</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s my key takeaways from this (and several other conversations over the last few weeks leading up to this):</p>

<ol>
<li>I am now a <em>maintainer</em>, which is quite a different thing from a <em>core contributor</em> or just a <em>contributor</em>. The power dynamics are very different, and so are the responsibilities. I can not ostrich myself into thinking I can just keep writing code and not do anything else - that&rsquo;s a disservice to not just other folks in the project, but also myself.</li>
<li>Being a maintainer is quite hard emotionally &amp; mentally. I&rsquo;ve a lot more respect for long running OSS maintainers now than I did before. I have a lot of personal work to do before I become anything like a decent maintainer.</li>
<li>Lots of people love Gerrit, and they also hate Gerrit :D Gerrit is very powerful, but the UX is so user hostile - I don&rsquo;t think these are unrelated. I hope that some of the power of Gerrit transfers to GitHub, but at the same time GitHub does not become anything like Gerrit! Also, people have very strong opinions about how their git histories should look like - perhaps they spend a lot more time looking through it than I do?</li>
<li>We are slowly developing better ways of dealing with Trolls in projects, but still have a long, long way to go. &ldquo;Look for the helpers&rdquo; here.</li>
</ol>

<p>It was also great to go to a short, well organized (un)conference targeted at diverse group of people who are still like me in some sense! Would go again, A+++!</p>

        designing data intensive applications

    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">Sun, Jul 2, 2017</span>

    

<p>I&rsquo;ve been reading <a href="http://dataintensive.net/">Designing Data Intensive Applications</a> book &amp; am using this post to keep notes!</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve picked up ideas on scaling systems through the years, but never actually sat down to actually study them semi-formally. This seems like a great start to it!</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a pretty big book, and it&rsquo;s gonna take me a while to go through it :) Will update these notes as I go! Trying to do a chapter a week!</p>

<h2 id="chapter-1-defining-all-the-things">Chapter 1: Defining all the things</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>The Internet was done so well that most people think of it as a natural resource like the Pacific Ocean, rather than something that was man-made. When was the last time a technology with a scale like that was so error-free?
Alan Kay, in <a href="www.drdobbs.com/architecture-and-design/interview-with-alan-kay/240003442">interview with Dr Dobb’s Journal (2012)</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>I keep forgetting what an amazing marvel the internet is and how intensely (and mostly positively, thankfully) it has affected my life. This is a good reminder! However, perhaps to people who haven&rsquo;t had the privileges I&rsquo;ve had the Internet doesn&rsquo;t feel like a natural resource? Unsure! Should ask them!</p>

<p>Lots of modern applications are data intensive, rather than CPU intensive.
&gt;  Raw CPU power is rarely a limiting factor for these applications—bigger problems are usually the amount of data, the complexity of data, and the speed at which it is changing.</p>

<p>This has borne out in the infrastructure I&rsquo;ve been setting up to help teach people data science - RAM is often the bottleneck, not CPU (barring machine-learning type stuff, but they want GPUs anyway).</p>

<p>Common building blocks for data intensive applications are:</p>

<ol>
<li>Store data so that they, or another application, can find it again later (databases)</li>
<li>Remember the result of an expensive operation, to speed up reads (caches)</li>
<li>Allow users to search data by keyword or filter it in various ways (search indexes)</li>
<li>Send a message to another process, to be handled asynchronously (stream processing)</li>
<li>Periodically crunch a large amount of accumulated data (batch processing)</li>
</ol>

<p>These <em>do</em> seem to cover a large variety of bases! I feel fairly comfortable in operating, using and building on top of some of these (databases, caches) but not so much in most (never used a search index, batch processing, nor streams outside of redis). Partially I haven&rsquo;t felt an intense need for these, but perhaps if I understand them more I&rsquo;ll use them more? I&rsquo;ve mostly strived to make everything stateless - but perhaps that&rsquo;s causing me to shy away from problems that can only be solved with state? /me ponders.</p>

<p>Boundaries around &lsquo;data systems&rsquo; are blurring - Redis is a cache but can be a message queue, Apache Kafka is a message queue that can have durability guarantees, etc. Lots of applications also need more than can be done with just one tool (aka a &lsquo;pure LAMP&rsquo; stack is no longer good enough). Applications often have the job of making sure different data sources are in sync. Everyone is a &lsquo;data designer&rsquo;, and everyone is kinda fucked.</p>

<p>Talk about 3 things that are most important to any software system.</p>

<h3 id="reliability">Reliability</h3>

<p>Means &lsquo;continue to work correctly, even when things go wrong&rsquo;. Things that go wrong are &lsquo;faults&rsquo;, and systems need to be &lsquo;fault-tolerent&rsquo; or &lsquo;resilient&rsquo;. Can&rsquo;t be tolerant of all faults, so gotta define what faults we&rsquo;re tolerant of.</p>

<p>Fault isn&rsquo;t failure - fault is when a component of the system &lsquo;deviates from its spec&rsquo;, <em>failure</em> is when the system as a whole stops providing user server they want. Can&rsquo;t reduce chances of fault to zero, but can work on reducing failures to zero.</p>

<p><strong>Engineering is building reliable systems from unreliable parts.</strong></p>

<p>Chaos monkeys are good, increase faults to find ways to reduce failure.</p>

<p>Hardware reliability - physical components fail. Nothing you can do about it. Fix it in software.</p>

<p>Hardware faults <em>usually</em> not corelated - one macine failing doesn&rsquo;t cause another machine to fail. To truly fuck shit up you need software - can easily cause massive large scale failure! For example, a leap second bug! Or a runaway process that slowly kills every other process on the machine. One of the microservies that 50 of your microservices depend on is slow! Cascading failures! These bugs all lie dormant, until they suddenly aren&rsquo;t and wreak havok. The software makes some assumption about its environment, which is true until it isn&rsquo;t. No quick solution to systematic software faults.</p>

<p>Human error is worst error. The book offers some suggestions on how to prevent these.</p>

<ol>
<li>Minimize opportunities for errors - make it easy to do the right thing. But if it&rsquo;s too restrictive, people will work around it - tricky balance.</li>
<li>Provide full featured sandboxes so people can fuck around without fucking shit up.</li>
<li>AUTOMATICALLY TEST EVERYTHING so when a human does fuck up, they know!</li>
<li>Set up undo functionality, so when human does fuck up, they can roll back!</li>
</ol>

<p>Learn about telemetry from other disciplines that have been doing this shit for far longer than us. <a href="https://xkcd.com/1831/">Relevant XKCD</a></p>

<p>Reliability isn&rsquo;t just for nukes &amp; aircraft &amp; election systems (haha). Imagine someone loses a video of their kid&rsquo;s first ever step because you didn&rsquo;t care. Fucking up is human and we all do it - what is important is that we care.</p>

<p>Sometimes you gotta sacrifice reliability, but make sure that is an explicit &amp; conscious decision. Actually throw away your prototypes! Put FIXMEs in your code. Take a shower. Make sure hacks look, feel and sound hacky!</p>

<h3 id="scalability">Scalability</h3>

<p>System&rsquo;s ability to adapt to increased &lsquo;load&rsquo; along some axes.</p>

<p>Load is described with various <em>load parameters</em>, which depend on the system (req/s? active users? etc).</p>

<p>Carefully define what this means for your application, and explain your reasoning. You might have to scale in some aspects but not in other.</p>

<p>Once you have the load parameters for your app defined, figure out what happens when you increase load parameters but keep system resources unchanged. After that, try to figure out how much resources need to be increased.</p>

<p>Throughput - number of things that can be done per second. Latency is time it takes to serve a request. These are common things we care about when we move load parameters up and down.</p>

<p>You shouldn&rsquo;t think of these as single numbers, since they vary a fair bit. Think of these as <em>probability distributions</em>. Learn some statistics! Use percentiles, rather than &lsquo;average&rsquo; or &lsquo;mean&rsquo;.</p>

<p>High percentile latencies are especially important when you are a service that&rsquo;s called by many other services - it can cascade down.</p>

<p>No <em>magic scaling sauce</em> - architecture that can scale is different for each application. But there are general purpose building blocks, so worry a little less!</p>

<h3 id="maintainability">Maintainability</h3>

<blockquote>
<p>Always code as if the person who ends up maintaining your code is a violent psychopath who knows where you live.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Split into three major aspects.</p>

<p><strong>Operability</strong></p>

<p>Make it easy for people to operate your service! Help them monitor the health of the system, observe &amp; debug problems, do capacity planning, keep the production environment stable, prevent single human points of failure (oh, only Chad knows about this system) and many other things!</p>

<p><strong>Simplicity</strong></p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t make your software a big ball of mud. Take into account that new engineers will have to start working on your software, and they need to understand it quickly.</p>

<p>Use standard tools &amp; approaches they have a higher likelihood of knowing - look around for standard tools before inventing your own!</p>

<p>Watch out for accidental complexity, and keep it to a minimum as much as possible. Abstractions are good, but abstractions are also leaky.</p>

<p><strong>Evolvability</strong></p>

<p>If your software is simple &amp; has good abstractions, you can change it over time without wanting to pull all your hair out.</p>

    <span class="post-date">Sat, May 13, 2017</span>

    

<p>Following a trail from a <a href="http://jvns.ca/blog/2017/04/17/statistics-for-programmers/">wonderful Julia Evans post</a> led me to Allen Downey&rsquo;s nice <a href="http://greenteapress.com/wp/textbook-manifesto/">textbook manifesto</a>. Also led me to the nice <a href="http://greenteapress.com/thinkos/index.html">Think OS</a> book, which seems like a super nice introduction to Operating System principles.</p>

<p>It is short enough (~100 pages) that I wanted to read through it. I&rsquo;ve spent a good chunk of time absorbing how Operating Systems work by dint of diving into things and working through them, but it would be nice to get a refresher on the basics. There are clearly basic things I do not understand, and this seemed like a good way to explore.</p>

<p>This post is just a running series of notes from me reading it on a nice saturday morning.</p>

<h2 id="stack-vs-heap">Stack vs Heap</h2>

<p>This is something that has always bugged me. I&rsquo;ve understood just enough of this by being burnt with pointers when writing C (and primitive types in the CLR, etc), but was lacking a deep understanding of wtf was going on. The fact that these are just process program segments (like text or data) was quite a revelation :D <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/79923/what-and-where-are-the-stack-and-heap">This stackoverflow answer</a> was also quite nice.</p>

<p>One interesting thing for me to investigate later from the book is how this program:</p>

<pre><code class="language-C">#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;

int global;

int main() {
  int local = 5;
  void *p = malloc(128);

  printf(&quot;Address of main is %p\n&quot;, main);
  printf(&quot;Address of local is %p\n&quot;, &amp;local);
  printf(&quot;Address of global is %p\n&quot;, &amp;global);
  printf(&quot;Address of p is %p\n&quot;, p);

}

</code></pre>

<p>produces the following output for the author:</p>

<pre><code>Address of main   is 0x      40057c
Address of local  is 0x7fffd26139c4
Address of global is 0x      60104c
Address of p      is 0x     1c3b010
</code></pre>

<p>but for me,</p>

<pre><code>Address of main   is 0x5598fc64c740
Address of local  is 0x7ffeacfaf75c
Address of global is 0x5598fc84d014
Address of p      is 0x5598fc85b010
</code></pre>

<p>The point of the program was to demonstrate that text (<code>main</code>), static (<code>global</code>) and heap (<code>p</code>) are near beginning of memory and stack (<code>local</code>) is towards the end. While on my laptop it does seem to be the case too, the &lsquo;start&rsquo; seems to be much farther out than on the author&rsquo;s computer. Need to understand why this is the case. I&rsquo;ve vaguely heard of address randomization &amp; other security measures in OS kernels - maybe related? For another day!</p>

<h2 id="bit-twiddling">Bit twiddling</h2>

<p>I continue to find it hard to care about bit twiddling. Most things do use it of course, but it seems to be abstracted away pretty well without leaking too much (except for things that have their own nuances, like floating point representations).</p>

<h2 id="malloc">malloc</h2>

<p>Nice link to <a href="http://gee.cs.oswego.edu/dl/html/malloc.html">a paper</a> about a common malloc implementation. I also know there are other malloc implementations that programs use (such as <a href="http://jemalloc.net/">jemalloc</a>). Something for me to dive into when I&rsquo;ve more time.</p>

<h2 id="tbc">tbc</h2>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t have time to finish it all, unfortunately. But shall come back to it whenever I can!</p>

<p>I am trying to understand SELinux and AppArmor, and collecting resources here as I learn. k</p>

<h2 id="selinux-for-mere-mortals-2014">SELinux for mere mortals (2014)</h2>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MxjenQ31b70" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<p>This was the first video I watched, and it helped me understanding what SELinux does at a fundamental basic level. It&rsquo;s probably useless in a container-filled world (where I doubt Fedora shipes pre-configured SELinux rules for my containers), but it helped me think I understood types / labels, so that seems like a positive step?</p>

<p>The fact the presenter keeps saying things like &lsquo;you being a good sysadmin, ssh into the server and edit the apache config file&rsquo; is freakin me out. If I&rsquo;m constantly editing config files on servers manually that seems like a massive failure to me :D How times change!</p>

<h2 id="docker-and-selinux-2014">Docker and SELinux (2014)</h2>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zWGFqMuEHdw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<p>This one made a lot more sense to me as an answer to the following questions:</p>

<ol>
<li>Aren&rsquo;t containers secure enough? (Partial answer)</li>
<li>What does SELinux do for container security?</li>
</ol>

<p>It&rsquo;s convinced me that container -&gt; host isolation and container &lt;-&gt; container isolation provided by SELinux is pretty simple and super useful, and should be turned on.</p>

<p>This talk also showed me this most wonderful <a href="https://people.redhat.com/duffy/selinux/selinux-coloring-book_A4-Stapled.pdf">coloring book</a> that tries to explain SELinux. If this is all that is to SELinux, it seems pretty simple and useful (for the container use case).</p>

<p>Also, it looks like there are more recent versions of both these two talks - I should look &lsquo;em up!</p>

<p>This is me trying to understand AppArmor, which seems to have lower base of support (just Ubuntu? Maybe SUSE, but idk anyone who uses SUSE) but theoretically simpler (mostly file path based). The video seems to be shot with a potato, so the slides aren&rsquo;t super clear - but the content is good enough to give me a super general overview.</p>

<p>The biggest thing against SELinux it talks about seems to be &lsquo;SELinux is complex&rsquo;, and not much else. I don&rsquo;t know how much I buy that - but then again, I haven&rsquo;t actually <em>used</em> SELinux anywhere :D</p>

<p>Unlike SELinux, I can actually see AppArmor rules on my local machine (since it is running Ubuntu). Seems fairly readable!</p>

<p>I was in a conversation about the Python GIL with friends a few days ago, and realized that my understanding of the specifics of the GIL problem were super hand-wavy &amp; unstructured. So I spent some time collecting resources to learn more, and now have a better understanding!</p>

<h4 id="python-s-infamous-gil-larry-hastings">Python&rsquo;s Infamous GIL (Larry Hastings)</h4>

<p>This was a <em>great</em> introduction to the history of the GIL, why it was necessary &amp; reasons why getting rid of it is complicated.</p>

<h4 id="understanding-the-python-gil-david-beazley">Understanding the Python GIL (David Beazley)</h4>

<p>This has wonderful visualizations that really helped me understand exactly <em>why</em> multi-threaded python behaves the way it does. Multithreading decreases performance, adding more cores decreases performance &amp; disabling cores increases performance :) All of this made vague hand-wavy sense to me before, and make much more concrete sense now.</p>

<h4 id="it-isn-t-easy-to-remove-the-gil-guido-van-rossum">It isn&rsquo;t easy to remove the GIL (Guido van Rossum)</h4>

<p>A <a href="http://www.artima.com/weblogs/viewpost.jsp?thread=214235">blog post</a> from the BDFL of python, after yet another request to &lsquo;just get rid of the GIL&rsquo;.</p>

<p>It set the (pretty high) bar for inclusion of a GIL removal patch (that he makes clear he will not write) in Python:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;d welcome a set of patches into Py3k only if the performance for a single-threaded program (and for a multi-threaded but I/O-bound program) does not decrease.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not been met yet!</p>

<h4 id="an-inside-look-at-the-gil-removal-patch-of-lore-dave-beazley">An Inside Look at the GIL Removal Patch of Lore (Dave Beazley)</h4>

<p>There was an attempt in about 1999 to remove the GIL - the &lsquo;freethreading&rsquo; patch. This is a <a href="http://dabeaz.blogspot.com/2011/08/inside-look-at-gil-removal-patch-of.html">wonderful analysis</a> of that patch - what it tried to do, why it disappeared, what the performance costs of it were, etc. Something that really stood out to me and makes me feel not very hopeful about GIL removal in CPython was:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Despite removing the GIL, I was unable to produce any performance experiment that showed a noticeable improvement on multiple cores. Really, the only benefit (ignoring the horrible performance) seen in pure Python code, was having preemptible instructions.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This seems to be still true, even in the Gilectomy branch.</p>

<h4 id="gilectomy-larry-hastings">Gilectomy (Larry Hastings)</h4>

<p>This is the only talk about a recent (~2016) GIL removal attempt.</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/P3AyI_u66Bw?ecver=1" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<p>It is amazing work, but doesn&rsquo;t give me much hope. There&rsquo;s been no new commits to the <a href="https://github.com/larryhastings/gilectomy/tree/gilectomy">public git repo</a> for about 5 months now, so am unsure what the state of it now is.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s probably many more - let me know if you know any, and I&rsquo;ll update this when I find out more!</p>

<p>It seems to have had a lot of intense work done on it, and the wall clock time graph in it warms my heart! I&rsquo;ve a little more hope now than I did after the 2016 talk :D</p>

        systemd simple containment for GUI applications &amp; shells
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">Fri, Mar 31, 2017</span>

    <p>I earlier had <a href="http://words.yuvi.in/post/systemd-gui-applications/">a vaguely working setup</a> for making sure browsers, shells and other applications don&rsquo;t eat all RAM / CPU on my machine with systemd + sudo + shell scripts.</p>

<p>It was a hacky solution, and also had complications when used to launch shells. It wasn&rsquo;t passing in all the environment varialbes it should, causing interesting-to-debug issues. <code>sudo</code> rules were complex, and hard to do securely.</p>

<p>I had also been looking for an excuse to learn more Golang, so I ended up writing <a href="https://github.com/yuvipanda/systemd-simple-containment"><code>systemd-simple-containment</code></a> or <code>ssc</code>.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a simple golang application that produces a binary that can be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Setuid"><code>setuid</code></a> to <code>root</code>, and thus get around all our <code>sudo</code> complexity, at the price of having to be very, very careful about the code. Fortunately, it&rsquo;s short enough (~100 lines) and <code>systemd-run</code> helps it keep the following invariants:</p>

<ol>
<li>It will never spawn any executable as any user other than the &lsquo;real&rsquo; uid / gid of the user calling the binary.</li>
<li>It doesn&rsquo;t allow arbitrary systemd <code>properties</code> to be set, ensuring a more limited attack surface.</li>
</ol>

<p>However, this is the first time I&rsquo;m playing with setuid and with Go, so I probably fucked something up. I feel ok enough about my understanding of real and effective uids for now to use it myself, but not to recommend it to other people. Hopefully I&rsquo;ll be confident enough say that soon :)</p>

<p>By using a real programming language, I also easily get commandline flags for sharing tty or not (so I can use the same program for launching GUI &amp; interactive terminal applications), pass all environment variables through (which can&rsquo;t be just standard child inheritence, since <code>systemd-run</code> doesn&rsquo;t work that way) &amp; the ability to setuid (you can&rsquo;t do that easily to a script).</p>

<p>I was sure I&rsquo;d hate writing go because of the constant <code>if err != nil</code> checks, but it hasn&rsquo;t bothered me that much. I would like to write more Go, to get a better feel for it. This code is too short to like a language, but I definitely hate it less :)</p>

<p>Anyway, now I can launch GUI applications with <code>ssc -tty=false -isolation=strict firefox</code> and it does the right thing. I currently have available <code>-isolation=strict</code> and <code>-isolation=relaxed</code>, the former performing stronger sandboxing (NoNewPrivileges, PrivateTmp) than the latter (just MemoryMax). i&rsquo;ll slowly add more protections here, but just keep two modes (ideally).</p>

<p>My Gnome Terminal shell command is now <code>ssc -isolation=relaxed /bin/bash -i</code> and it works great :)</p>

<p>I am pretty happy with <code>ssc</code> as it exists now. Only thing I now want to do is to be able to use it from the GNOME launcher (I am using GNOME3 with gnome-shell). Apparently <em>shortcuts</em> are no longer cool and hence pretty hard to create in modern desktop environments :| I shall keep digging!</p>

        systemd gui applications

    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">Wed, Mar 29, 2017</span>

    

<p><strong>Update</strong>: There&rsquo;s a <a href="//words.yuvi.in/post/systemd-simple-containment/">follow-up post</a> with a simpler solution now.</p>

<p>Ever since I read <a href="https://blog.jessfraz.com">Jessie Frazelle</a>&rsquo;s amazing setup (<a href="https://blog.jessfraz.com/post/ultimate-linux-on-the-desktop/">1</a>, <a href="https://blog.jessfraz.com/post/docker-containers-on-the-desktop/">2</a>, <a href="https://blog.jessfraz.com/post/runc-containers-on-the-desktop/">3</a>) for running GUI applications in docker containers, I&rsquo;ve wanted to do something similar. However, I want to install things on my computer - not in docker images. So what I wanted was just isolation (no more Chrome / Firefox freezing my laptop), not images. I&rsquo;m also not as awesome (or knowledgeable!) as Jess, so will have to naturally settle for less&hellip;</p>

<p>So I am doing it in systemd!</p>

<p>Before proceeding, I want to warn y&rsquo;all that I don&rsquo;t entirely know what I am doing. Don&rsquo;t take any of this as security advice, since I don&rsquo;t entirely understand X&rsquo;s security model. Works fine for me though!</p>

<h2 id="gui-applications">GUI applications</h2>

<p>I started out using a simple systemd <a href="https://fedoramagazine.org/systemd-template-unit-files/">templated service</a> to launch GUI applications, but soon realized that <a href="https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd-run.html">systemd-run</a> is probably the better way. So I&rsquo;ve a simple script, <code>/usr/local/bin/safeapp</code>:</p>

<pre><code class="language-bash">#!/bin/bash
exec sudo systemd-run  \
    -p CPUQuota=100% \
    -p MemoryMax=70% \
    -p WorkingDirectory=$(pwd) \
    -p PrivateTmp=yes \
    -p NoNewPrivileges=yes \
    --setenv DISPLAY=${DISPLAY} \
    --setenv DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS=${DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS} \
    --uid ${USER} \
    --gid ${USER} \
    --quiet \
    &quot;$1&quot;
</code></pre>

<p>I can run <code>safeapp /opt/firefox/firefox</code> now and it&rsquo;ll start firefox inside a nice systemd unit with a 70% Memory usage cap and CPU usage of at most 1 CPU. There&rsquo;s also other minimal security stuff applied - <code>NoNewPrivileges</code> being the most important one. I want to get <code>ProtectSystem</code> + <code>ReadWriteDirectories</code> going too, but there seems to be a bug in <code>systemd-run</code> that doesn&rsquo;t let it parse <code>ProtectSystem</code> properly&hellip;</p>

<p>Also, there&rsquo;s <a href="https://github.com/systemd/systemd/issues/3851">an annoying bug</a> in systemd v231 (which is what my current system has) - you can&rsquo;t set <code>CPUQuotas</code> over 100% (aka &gt; 1 CPU core). This is annoying if you want to give each application 3 of your 4 cores (which is what I want). Next version of Ubuntu has v232, so my GUI applications will just have to do with an aggregate of 1 full core until then.</p>

<p>The two environment variables seem to be all that&rsquo;s necessary for X applications to work.</p>

<p>And yes, this might ask you for your password. I&rsquo;ll clean this up into a nice non-bash script hopefully soon, and make all of these better.</p>

<p>Anyway, <em>it works</em>! I can now open sketchy websites with scroll hijacking without fear it&rsquo;ll kill my machine!</p>

<h2 id="cli">CLI</h2>

<p>I wanted each tab in my terminal to be its own systemd service, so they all get equitable amount of  CPU time &amp; can&rsquo;t crash machine by themselves with OOM.</p>

<p>So I&rsquo;ve this script as <code>/usr/local/bin/safeshell</code></p>

<pre><code class="language-bash">`#!/bin/bash
exec sudo systemd-run \
    -p CPUQuota=100% \
    -p MemoryMax=70% \
    -p WorkingDirectory=$(pwd) \
    --uid yuvipanda \
    --gid yuvipanda \
    --quiet \
    --tty \
    /bin/bash -i
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>--tty</code> is magic here, and does the right things wrt passing the tty that GNOME terminal is passing in all the way to the shell. Now, my login command (set under profile preferences &gt; command in gnome-terminal) is <code>sudo /usr/local/bin/safeshell</code>. In addition, I add the following line to <code>/etc/sudoers</code>:</p>

<pre><code>%sudo ALL = (root) NOPASSWD:SETENV: /usr/local/bin/safeshell
</code></pre>

<p>This + just specifying the username directly in <code>safeshell</code> are both hacks that make me cringe a little. I need to either fully understand how sudo&rsquo;s <code>-E</code> works, or use this as an opportunity to learn more Go and make a setuid binary.</p>

<h2 id="to-do">To do</h2>

<p>[ ] Generalize this to not need hacks (either with better sudo usage or a setuid binary)
[ ] Investigate adding more security related options.
[ ] Make these work with desktop / dock icons.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d normally have just never written this post, on account of &lsquo;oh no, it is imperfect&rsquo; or something like that. However, that also seems to have come in the way of ability to find joy in learning simple things :D So I shall follow <a href="https://jvns.ca/">b0rk</a>&rsquo;s lead in spending time <a href="http://words.yuvi.in/post/things-to-learn/">learning</a> for fun again :)</p>

<p>I ran into this thought provoking though when randomly attempting to relax this weekend. There&rsquo;s a summary at <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/712376/">LWN</a> if you do not want to watch the talk - but as the lwn summarizer admits, the video definitely conveys things that are hard to capture on text.</p>

<p>The core takeaway for me is to think about:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>what is the future of free and open-source software? The answer was: it has no future.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This seems somehow connected to &lsquo;democratizing programming&rsquo;, which I had earlier given a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEyqVXzCJJc">talk about</a>. Somehow, it feels like there needs to be an update / rebirth of the <a href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html">GNU Freedoms</a> for the world we live in.</p>

    <span class="post-date">Fri, Feb 3, 2017</span>

    <p>I went to the protests at SFO last weekend. It was the first real set of protests I&rsquo;ve been to. I write this to attempt to capture a sliver of what I felt that day.</p>

<p>I was there for about 10h on day 1, and came home exhausted. I went back on Day 2, and this time stayed for much shorter period of time (~4h?) before heading back home.</p>

<p>To everyone who was at the protest even if it does not directly affect you yet - <em>thank you</em>!</p>

<p>To the wonderful amazing women of color who were leading the protest - <em>thank you</em>. You are an inspiration.</p>

<p>To the brass band and the troupe of drummers who showed up - <em>thank you</em>!</p>

<p>To the people I already know from other contexts who I ran into at the protest - <em>thank you</em>!</p>

<p>To those who were protesting for the first time in their lives (as I was) - <em>thank you</em>!</p>

<p>To the fucking ACLU - <em>thank you</em>! I&rsquo;ll send you all the money I can :)</p>

<p>To the people who provided infrastructure (food, water, snacks, first aid, printers, internet, etc) - <em>thank you</em>!</p>

<p>To the journalists who covered this - <em>thank you</em>.</p>

<p>I woke up that saturday feeling very depressed, angry, and helpless. By sunday night, I was only depressed and angry - but not helpless. The number and variety of people at the protests was very heartwarming, and made me feel distinctly not alone. Before going I was not sure what going to a protest accomplishes. I still do not know - but I know it gave me hope and restored my sense of agency.</p>

<p>I promise I&rsquo;ll continue doing all I can, even and especially when it is about things that do not affect me yet. I hope you do too.</p>

<p>What hurts the victim most is not the cruelty of the oppressor but the silence of the bystander</p>

    <p>I&rsquo;ve unfollowed everyone I follow on Twitter, and am slowly starting back up from scratch. I&rsquo;m only going to follow people who are:</p>

<ol>
<li>Underrepresented people in Tech (as broadly construed)</li>
<li>Journalists</li>
</ol>

<p>And that&rsquo;s it. I&rsquo;ll follow back friends I&rsquo;m not otherwise in contact with as well, but might take a while.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve had this for a few days and am already enjoying using it far more than I did before. A lot of the people I&rsquo;m following now I did not know before, and the vibe is totally different. I&rsquo;m able to understand and appreciate things I was not able to before. I know this is a bubble, but it is certainly a different bubble than the one I was in before. Bubbles also intersect - I&rsquo;ve interactions with other types of people elsewhere, just not on Twitter.</p>

<p>If I unfollowed you, don&rsquo;t take it personally! DM me for a phone number you can use for Signal / WhatsApp / Telegram - that&rsquo;s how 90% of my social activities seem to happen these days anyway.</p>

<p>h/t to <a href="http://www.gaijin.com/">Jorm</a> for the idea of targetted following!</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: I&rsquo;ve also setup <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/leechblock/">LeechBlock</a> to only allow me 5mins of Twitter every 2h, and I don&rsquo;t have the twitter app on my phone. I wish there was a leechblock type thing for my Phone tho.</p>

        UCI Conflicts Class: Notes from Week 1 – Part I
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">Sat, Apr 9, 2016</span>

    

<p>I&#8217;ve started taking a Coursera class on <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/types-of-conflict/">Conflicts</a> from UCI.</p>

<p>Just dumping notes from me going through the video lectures here. I&#8217;ve a bunch more videos to go through for Week 1, but dumping what I have for now.</p>

<p>Types of Conflict:</p>

<ol>
<li>Constructive</li>
<li>Destructive

<ol>
<li>Caused by lack of flexibility, getting interpersonal things get in the way and the sureness that ones way is the right way</li>
<li>Leads to stiffling of anything new, resulting in &#8216;this is the way things have always been&#8217; being used as an actual legitimate reason for things</li>
</ol></li>
</ol>

<p>Sources of Conflict</p>

<ol>
<li>Economic Conflict. Resources are scarce, people tend to hoard them. Individuals stand by and watch as other members look for resources and can not find them, without helping. Dysfunctional.</li>
<li>Value Conflict. Ideals / Principles / Preferences. Very difficult to sort out. Some values you hold very dear might be opposite to what the environment supports. You bring your own definition of values, and expect others to be compatible with it, conflict ensues. Individuals expect everyone to behave / believe / follow same philosophy they do.</li>
<li>Power &amp; Control. Power some people decide who they are. Titles are important. Individual takes power in always being first to speak, forcing their decision on rest of their team. Nobody&#8217;s appointed someone to a position, and they decide they are the one who takes the lead role, even though they have not that much support from elsewhere.</li>
<li>Interpersonal conflict. Just between two individuals who can just not get along or not have civil interactions. They might&#8217;ve been friends at some point even, but something happens and splits them off. This can also be very dysfunctional for the team they work in.</li>
</ol>

<p>Levels of Conflict 5. Role conflict &#8211; without clear definition who plays what roles (leader, decision maker, etc). Defining a team requires outlining responsibilities and what role they play. (This can probably lead to 3, 2, 1, 4, if not handled properly) 6. Intergroup. Inter group can be same as 1-5 but as groups, but can also be about respect. Example: Sales and Marketing fighting over who is the reason their product sucks. Groups can be silo&#8217;d can can think they are only responsible for their own success / failure, without thinking of cross-team stuff. 7. Multiparty. In M&amp;A, the &#8216;surrendering party&#8217; will have individuals who will be emotional and not like that this is happening. This is a lot of (5, 3, 2, 1) &#8211; freefall for everyone! 8. International. Diverse work force, cross cultural. Far more complex</p>

<h2 id="case-study-overtime">Case study: Overtime</h2>

<p>Manager asks you to work overtime, not get paid, cites projects being overtime etc.</p>

<p>Multiple options &#8211; such as: 1. suck up to him. 2. ask him to fuck off. 3. report him to his own boss. 4. Say you understand his perspective, but do not want to go against company policy.</p>

<p>Now, the course suggests you pick (4), which is an interesting choice &#8211; I would&#8217;ve picked (2), but that is not going to decrease teh amount of conflict, only increase it. (4) is bullshyt (in the anathema sense of vague euphemism that doesn&#8217;t actually say what the person means), but is something that leads to the least amount of conflict. However, I don&#8217;t know if that really is the best way to handle this shitty situation &#8211; since that&#8217;s just going to lead to bullshit all around. It does, though, AGF on part of the manager &#8211; which depending on what you think, might or might not be a good idea. Hmmm..</p>

<p>Bullshit vs Conflict? Maybe you have to have one or the other. OSS projects that consider (4) to be just bullshit do indeed have more amounts of conflict.</p>

<p>Of course, the real solution is to be not in such a place at all, and make the environment be that way through some form or way. So maybe (4) is an acceptable answer&#8230;</p>

<p>Very fascinating!</p>

<h2 id="case-study-dominant-team-member">Case study: Dominant team member</h2>

<p>Putting down everyone else, making everything not go well.</p>

<ol>
<li>Why is this individual behaving this way?</li>
<li>What do you need to do to bring the team back together in one cohesive unit?</li>
</ol>

<p>Has even more what-I-would-call-bullshit suggestions. &#8220;Setup roles for meetings, have a discussion about norms&#8221;, etc. <em>However</em>, they all could possibly work, which isn&#8217;t true for what I would&#8217;ve done &#8211; which is to PM the person and talk to them.</p>

<p>I guess there is a difference between &#8216;doing the right thing as you think it is&#8217; vs &#8216;doing the thing that has highest probability of getting you to objective&#8217;. Now, with corporations said objective is easy to define &#8211; make more money, I guess &#8211; while for movements it it is much harder&#8230;</p>

<h2 id="case-study-convo-with-coworker">Case study: Convo with coworker</h2>

<p>You had a conversation with coworker, and didn&#8217;t feel it went well. What do you do?</p>

<ol>
<li>Explore what your feelings are, and what it is that you specifically feel didn&#8217;t go right. When you do this, you clear away emotions that could possibly be clouding ways for solutions. Focus only on the facts.</li>
<li>Go to actual peer, be open to receiving their position / feedback. LISTEN TO UNDERSTAND BEFORE BEING UNDERSTOOD.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="interview-brent-rasmussen">Interview: Brent Rasmussen</h2>

<p>Everyone assumed they were responsible for some part of the website, and everyone had different ideas for what it is. Need to explicitly figure out who is responsible for what and who is in a &#8216;consultive&#8217; role.</p>

<p>Positive conflict can raise the bar, for things that other people did not think are possible.</p>

<p>For destructive conflict, figure out when is the right time to discuss it.</p>

        Side Project: UA Emoji Firefox Extension
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">Mon, Mar 28, 2016</span>

    <p><em>Note: I&#8217;m trying to spend time explicitly writing random side projects that are not related to what I&#8217;m actively working on as my main project in some form.</em></p>

<p>A random thread started by <a href="https://twitter.com/quominus">Ironholds</a> on a random mailing list I was wearily catching up on contained a joke from <a href="https://twitter.com/bearloga">bearloga</a> about malformed User Agents. This prompted me to write <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/uauliver/?src=search">UAuliver</a> (<a href="https://github.com/yuvipanda/uauliver-firefox-extension">source</a>), a Firefox extension that randomizes your user agent to be a random string of emoji. This breaks a surprisingly large number of software, I&#8217;m told! (GMail &amp; Gerrit being the ones I explicitly remember)</p>

<p>Things I learnt from writing this:</p>

<ol>
<li>Writing Addons for Firefox is far easier to get started with than they were the last time I looked. Despite the confusing naming (Jetpack API == SDK != WordPress&#8217; Jetpack API != Addons != Plugins != WebExtension), the documentation and tooling were nice enough that I could finish all of this in a few hours!</li>
<li>I can still write syntactically correct Javascript! \o/</li>
<li>Generating a &#8216;string of emoji&#8217; is easier/harder than you would think, depending on how you would like to define &#8217;emoji&#8217;. The fact that Unicode deals in blocks that at least in this case aren&#8217;t too split up made this quite easy (I used the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emoji#Unicode_blocks">list</a> on Wikipedia to generate them). JS&#8217;s <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/fromCodePoint">String.fromCodePoint</a> can also be used to detect if the codepoint you just generated randomly is actually allocated.</li>
<li>I don&#8217;t actually know how HTTP headers deal with encoding and unicode. This is something I need to actually look up. Perhaps a re-read of the HTTP RfC is in order!</li>
</ol>

<p>It was a fun exercise, and I might write more Firefox extensions in the future!</p>

        Paper notes: ‘The impact of syntax colouring on program comprehension’
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">Wed, Mar 9, 2016</span>

    <p>I&#8217;ve recently started reading more academic papers, and thought it&#8217;d be useful to write notes about them and publish them as I go along! This one is for <a href="http://www.ppig.org/sites/default/files/2015-PPIG-26th-Sarkar.pdf">The impact of syntax colouring on program comprehension</a></p>

<ul>
<li>I was amazed at the amount of prior research it is citing. Why have I not been reading these for the last 10 years of my life?</li>
<li>Apparently it is ok to report findings with a sample size of 10 people. I do not know how I feel about this.</li>
<li>The fact that there&#8217;s a large amount of thought put into the design of the experiment is quite nice, and surprisingly different from environments I&#8217;ve worked in the past where product managers designed &#8216;experiments&#8217;</li>
<li><code>To avoid datatype-related confusion, a uniform variable naming scheme was adopted in the tasks. For example, integers were named x, y, etc. and lists were named list1, list2, etc.</code>. As someone pretty used to Python, I would have found this annoying &#8211; but I&#8217;m curious what the effect of identifier names is in program comprehension. It also reminded me I haven&#8217;t written any code in a stronger typed language in a while (I don&#8217;t think Java counts)</li>
<li>They used Solarized Color Scheme, which has a lot of fans although I&#8217;ve never been one.</li>
<li>Lots of self-reporting for &#8216;programming proficiency&#8217;. This is the &#8216;we give up!&#8217; answer to measuring programming proficiency, I guess :)</li>
<li><code>We gathered data from 10 graduate computer science students at the University of Cambridge.</code> This too seems fairly common, but I&#8217;ve no idea if such an un-diverse group of student group being studied affects the results at all?</li>
<li>They also discarded data from 3 of the students because they wore glasses and their eye-tracking hardware could not really deal with that. So this entire paper is from data from 7 students doing one particular course from one particular university.</li>
<li><code>We use the Shapiro-Wilk test to establish normality. We use the Wilcoxon signed rank test (WSRT) for paired nonparametric comparisons</code>. I know some of these words!</li>
<li><code>As the data was not normally distributed, a 2-way ANNOVA could not be used to investigate the interaction of experience with highlighting on task times</code> I know <em>most</em> of the words, but still can not make sense of this sentence.</li>
<li>Currently feeling very illiterate, but am sure this is just a feeling that will pass.</li>
<li><code>. The median difference in task completion time was 8.4s in favour of highlighting.</code> To my untrained brain, that does not seem that much to me.</li>
<li><code>The presence of syntax highlighting significantly reduces task completion time, but the magnitude of this effect decreases as programming experience increase</code> &#8211; this is their primary conclusion, which I can totally believe. But would I have believed it if they had come to a different conclusion? Would they have published it if it had? Would they have if there was more data? I don&#8217;t fully understand / know Academia enough to know.</li>
<li>I wonder if there has been research into richer forms of syntax highlighting &#8211; not just keyword based ones, but more contextual. Perhaps based on types (autodetected?), or scope, or usage frequency, or source, or whatever.</li>
</ul>

<p>Overall, I enjoyed reading it &#8211; good paper! Thought provoking in some forms, but could&#8217;ve aimed higher, I suppose. I hope they continue doing good work!</p>

        DNS servers, localhost and asynchronous code
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">Thu, Feb 4, 2016</span>

    <p><code>localhost</code> is always <code>127.0.0.1</code>, right? Nope, can also be <code>::1</code> if your system only has IPV6 (apparently).</p>

<p>Asking a DNS server for an A record for <code>localhost</code> should give you back <code>127.0.0.1</code> right? Nope &#8211; it varies wildly! <code>8.8.8.8</code> gives me an <code>NXDOMAIN</code> which means it tells you straight up THIS DOMAIN DOES NOT EXIST! Which is true, since localhost isn&#8217;t a domain. But if you ask the same thing of any dnsmasq server, it&#8217;ll tell you localhost is 127.0.0.1. Other servers vary wildly &#8211; I found one that returned an <code>NXDOMAIN</code> for AAAA but 127.0.0.1 for A (which is pretty wild, since <code>NXDOMAIN</code> makes most software treat the domain as not existing and not attempt other lookups). So localhost and DNS servers don&#8217;t mix very well.</p>

<p>But why is this a problem, in general? Most DNS resolution happens via <code>gethostbyname</code> libc call, which reads <code>/etc/hosts</code> properly, right? Problem there is that there is popular software that&#8217;s completely asynchronous (_cough_nginx<em>cough</em>) that does <em>not</em> use <code>gethostbyname</code> (since that&#8217;s synchronous) and directly queries DNS servers (asynchronously). This works perfectly well until you try to hit <code>localhost</code> and it tells you &#8216;no such thing!&#8217;.</p>

<p>I should probably file a bug with nginx to have them read <code>/etc/hosts</code> as well, and in the mean-time work around by sending <code>127.0.0.1</code> to nginx rather than localhost.</p>

<p>How did <em>your</em> thursday go?</p>

    <p>Clearly I missed an entire week. I need to build a better system to make this easier&#8230;</p>

<p>Random notes.</p>

<ul>
<li>Kicked out NFS from the Tool Labs proxies (with <a href="https://gerrit.wikimedia.org/r/#/c/260424/">1</a>). Yay! This hopefully explains the lockup of tools-proxy-01 yesterday night, maybe? It&#8217;s been restarted since, and I hope to no longer have instances randomly locoking on me. Infrastructure standards of 2009, here we come! :D I&#8217;ve also removed NFS from tools-redis, and migrated them to Jessie as well.</li>
<li>Fixed up all the races in how kubernetes workers are setup with <a href="https://gerrit.wikimedia.org/r/#/c/260501/">2</a></li>
<li>Another instance is &#8216;stuck&#8217; again. Sigh. AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA. Paravoid helped debug this, tracking it down to NFS client issues in the 4.2 kernel (See <a href="https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T121998">phab</a>). I moved k8s nodes back to a working 3.19 kernel (after filing <a href="https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T122284">issue</a> about the other 3.19 kernel package I tried that didn&#8217;t work).</li>
<li>Moved the tools proxies to 4.2 (lol?) after finding out huge ksoftirqd spikes in them. Let&#8217;s see if that improves things</li>
<li>I split up the individual components of PAWS, and have a working <a href="https://github.com/yuvipanda/nbserve">nbserve</a> in there now! Exciting times. Need to fixup nbserve to use traitlets for config</li>
<li>Big Tool Labs outage (again!). Some tool accidentally sent about 12million job requests and crashed gridengine&#8217;s underlying backing store (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkeley_DB">BerkeleyDB</a>). Reset to a clean slate after many hours (Thanks Coren!) and mostly things are back up now. I&#8217;m reading through the Berkeley DB <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs276a/projects/docs/berkeleydb/">reference manual</a> now.</li>
<li>Persistance failed for ores&#8217;s redises again, mostly because <code>vm_overcommit</code> was turned off. Fixed in the core redis module so it does not happen again.</li>

    <p>Probably going to take it easy and chill. Already sent a <a href="https://github.com/kjschiroo/WikiChatter/pull/13">trivial PR</a> up though.</p>

<p>Also saw the old <a href="http://librelist.com/browser/devlog/">devlog mailing list</a> and feeling happy memories. Clearly need to bring something back like that, but I don&#8217;t know / think mailing lists are the best medium. More thinking!</p>

<p>Ended up learning some <a href="http://tornadoweb.org/">Tornad</a> and wrote <a href="https://github.com/yuvipanda/nbserve">nbserve</a> to serve rendered notebooks and static files in a configurable way. I should refactor PAWS to have separate jupyterhub, proxy and nbserve pods tomorrow. Also need to test for path traversal attacks and whatnot. Also coroutine based programming is a lot easier than I had originally thought! woo!</p>

<li>Today looks like a day of finding, reporting and fixing bugs in <a href="https://github.com/kjschiroo/WikiChatter">WikiChatter</a>. I had made a stupid mistake yesterday that meant not all of the Teahouse pages were being parsed, and I immediately started running into bugs. Have reported (and fixed!) two (<a href="https://github.com/kjschiroo/WikiChatter/issues/8">1</a> and <a href="https://github.com/kjschiroo/WikiChatter/issues/9">2</a>), and ran into another <a href="https://github.com/earwig/mwparserfromhell/issues/55#issuecomment-166033817">bug</a> in mediawikiparserfromhell itself. I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;ll find more.

<li>Another bug in WikiChatter! <a href="https://github.com/kjschiroo/WikiChatter/issues/12">3</a></li>
<li>Perils of digging through archives &#8211; you find Wikipedians giving <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Teahouse/Questions/Archive_105#relationship_help">relationship advice</a>.</li>

    <p>Haven&#8217;t done these in a while, let&#8217;s see if I can get this back on the wagon!</p>

<ul>
<li>Discovered the <a href="https://github.com/kjschiroo/WikiChatter">WikiChatter</a> library (thanks to @halfak!), and using that in my Teahouse analysis notebook. Far better than writing my own parser and fighting with that. Lets me get on with the actual fun stuff I wanted to do (which is the actual analysis)</li>
<li>Learning about pandas, checking out matplotlib, bokeh and wordcloud libraries to use in the analysis. Have included matplotlib and bokeh (and with it, pandas and numpy) in the default libraries list for PAWS, and also fixed permissions so users can pip install stuff themselves too.</li>
<li>For context, I&#8217;m trying to do an analysis of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Teahouse">English Wikipedia Teahouse</a> questions archive, mostly as a way of showing off what <a href="https://tools.wmflabs.org/paws">PAWS</a> makes possible.</li>
<li>Also spent a good chunk of the day regretting previous life decisions. All temporary however &#8211; nothing irreversible was done, which is wonderful. Should figure out how to reduce likeliness of similar events happening in the future.</li>
<li>Docker build times on my machine are pathetic, both because of slow network (USA! USA! USA!) and cheap laptop. Need to find a proper solution to this soon.</li>

<p>Trying out the <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/byword/id420212497?mt=12">ByWord</a> app, since it has MarkDown support and also publishes to WordPress. Paid Rs. 900 for it, let&#8217;s hope it is useful. Hate the default font, though.</p>

<ul>
<li>Need to parse View definitions on labsdb public databases and verify that we aren&#8217;t leaking any info (<a href="https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T85783">https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T85783</a>). Was going to use the <a href="https://code.google.com/p/python-sqlparse/">sqlparse</a> library, but that doesn&#8217;t seem very complete or useful. Will attempt to use regexes now. Wish I had learnt how to build parsers properly easily.</li>
<li>Ignore lament ^, I spent some time learning to use PyParsing, and ended up with a very simple parser that parsed the small subset of SQL I cared about! Yay :) Still need to set aside some time at some point to fully understand parsers/parsing.</li>
<li>Fixed wikdidata beta not resolving (<a href="https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T85793">https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T85793</a>). Of course, problem was caused by me as well, not verifying that DNS changes I was making didn&#8217;t have unintended consequences. It&#8217;s also somewhat surprising that it was down for 6 days before someone noticed.</li>
<li>Add labsdb-auditor report that verifies views have appropriately done definitions that do not expose private information (<a href="https://gerrit.wikimedia.org/r/#/c/182848/">https://gerrit.wikimedia.org/r/#/c/182848/</a>). This was fun to write. I should definitely learn more parsing things and seek out other simpel things I can write a parser for. Code quality is getting better, although could still be better if I can remove the regex part entirely &#8211; it currently cleans up the SQL via a regex and then parses it with pyparsing.</li>

    <p>Nothing much going on&#8230;</p>

<ul>
<li>Continue reading Real World Haskell. This is indeed expanding my horizons, but I haven&#8217;t found any project I could use haskell in yet. Will keep looking.</li>
<li>Helped fix a parsoid outage yesterday. No biggie. I still do not understand fully how parsoid works / how it is set up, should do.</li>
<li>Spend most of the rest of the time in &#8216;weekend mode&#8217;, which includes mostly not doing things. That went mostly well.</li>
<li>Watched &#8216;Pink Floyd The Wall&#8217; movie. HOLY FUCK MY MIND IT IS GONE OMG IT IS QUITE REALLY NICE. Recommended.</li>
</ul>

<p>I should probably write a &#8216;Year in Review 2014&#8217; post, but so much of that is going to be NSFW and private that there probably is no point&#8230; ;)</p>

    <p>Woohoo, 2015! :) Let&#8217;s see if I can keep this going this time :)</p>

<ul>
<li>Have started taking weekends slightly more seriously. My brain feels less overwhelmed after that. Should take weekends even more seriously going forward.</li>
<li>Merged <code>labsdb-auditor</code> <a href="https://gerrit.wikimedia.org/r/#/c/182164/">rewrite patch</a>. Code clean enough for my tastes now, although not documented enough. Lots of back and forth CR with valhallasw was really nice &#8211; it&#8217;s something I&#8217;ve been missing for the past few months. Debating over style and cleanliness was also interesting. Felt like I had been taking code cleanliness and proper design not as seriously as I should have, and this is now time to change that. Also spent time consciously thinking about the commit message I was writing, and shall continue doing that. I think I&#8217;ve taken a few things for granted wrt code quality and design, and should be more careful. And learnt a few more tricks about decorators (haven&#8217;t built decorators that are parameterized before).</li>
<li>Read a few chapters of <a href="http://book.realworldhaskell.org/">Real World Haskell</a>. Quite nice, although the syntax feels a bit too dense for my tastes. Still should maybe write things with <a href="http://www.call-cc.org/">ChickenScheme</a> instead :)</li>
<li>Continuing re-reading Coders at Work, which continues to be a thought provoking, wonderful book.</li>

    <p>Was a great idea! It just worked (with an OTP cable), and I can now probably find much more uses for this thing than I could before. Yay!</p>

<p>I wonder if I can use this to write code. However, a 7 inch tablet is very poorly suited for that task &#8211; would need at least a 10&#8243; one. But there aren&#8217;t many of those going around these days&#8230;</p>

<p>I&#8217;ll probably use this for random browsing / commenting, and use my Mac for actual programming.</p>

    <p>That was a long break. Should get into better habits. I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;d miss some here. Oh well.</p>

<p>It was a very interesting week, culminating in some very interesting things at Trafalgar Square. I feel much better as a person and more calmer/chilled out now :) Should remember to take weekends off.</p>

<ul>
<li>Helped the <a href="http://metrics.wmflabs.org/">WikiMetrics</a> people with some puppet changes. They were requiring mysql directly instead of using the class we have in ops/puppet, which meant it put data in the /var partition instead of in /srv. This was because they want to be a &#8216;proper&#8217; independent puppet module, not depending on the other modules in ops/puppet (since the module is used in vagrant as well). Puppet has <em>terrible</em> support for this kind of thing, and ops/puppet by itself also suffers from an incredible amount of NIH syndrome when it comes to modules. Some of the NIH-so-rewrite is justified, but I don&#8217;t think all of it is. Oh well. Hopefully something that can be fixed over time&#8230;</li>
<li>Added basic icinga/graphite based monitoring for contint project (runs our jenkins installation). Quite trivial, but should be ported over to shinken at some point soon.</li>
<li>Contributed a fair bit to the <a href="https://github.com/erming/shout">Shout</a> Web IRC project. I was looking around for an open source replacement to <a href="https://irccloud.com">IRCCloud</a>, and found a bunch of OSS projects (<a href="https://github.com/thedjpetersen/subway">Subway</a> and <a href="http://ircanywhere.com/">http://ircanywhere.com/</a> being the others). Shout seemed the most active (and simplest) of them all &#8211; I couldn&#8217;t actually get the others to a working installation. I fixed a bunch of code formatting issues, and also added a couple of features (<a href="https://github.com/erming/shout/pull/138">Desktop notifications</a> being the most significant, I think). The maintainer was fun to work with, and merged most of my changes quite promptly. I hang out on <code>#shout-irc</code> channel now, and activity seems to be speeding along. Should be fun to see how it goes :)</li>
<li>Moved off IRCCloud. Stopped paying for it. I&#8217;ve also stopped doing email on my phone, in an effort to be more minimalistic / less distracted all the time. This meant no more IRC on phone, so my primary reason for using IRCCloud disappeared. Am back to using LimeChat with my ZNC bouncer now. And nothing on my phone. In case of emergencies, I still have the IRCCloud app on my phone, and can use the free edition to connect to my bouncer temporarily.</li>
<li>Started working on labs-specific monitoring, with <a href="http://shinken-monitoring.org">shinken</a> &#8211; test instance at <a href="http://shinken.wmflabs.org">shinken.wmflabs.org</a>. Discussion in the ops list about how to best implement this. Shinken is supposed to horizontally scale much better than icinga since it is implemented as a bunch of different daemons that can talk over the network. Right now they are just one machine, but will probably expand at some point not too far away. They are running as a labs project rather than on a physical machine (<code>labmon1001</code>) because it is much easier from a networking perspective. Right now it only has a simple http check for betacluster, but more coming.</li>
<li>Started refactoring all our icinga code. Separating them out into <code>nagios_commmon</code> module for config that can be shared between shinken and icinga, and into an <code>icinga</code> module for everything else. Moved all the custom checks and check config we have, moving other things as we go. This is a bit hard / frustrating since I don&#8217;t have access to the machine icinga runs on (<code>neon</code>), and also because I still do not have +2 in our ops repo (should change in a month, tho!). Am about 40 patches in (small ones!), let&#8217;s see how many more it takes!</li>
<li>Moved our <code>dsh</code> code into a module. Was fairly trivial. Now to find ways to get it merged :)</li>
<li>Started trying out <a href="http://pinboard.in">pinboard</a>. Interesting, barebones design. The bookmarklet is a bit slow to load, though. Let&#8217;s see how often I use this. (I did pay for it)</li>
</ul>

<p>Five more days left in the UK :( Let me see if I can continue doing these when here, in a more prompt manner.</p>

    <span class="post-date">Thu, Sep 11, 2014</span>

    <p>Back from an <em>awesome</em> vacation. Too awesome to write about, even :) Suffice it to say, England has some really pretty places.</p>

<p>Some Android app work, and lots of monitoring work</p>

<ul>
<li>Fixed bugs causing the <a href="https://tools.wmflabs.org/wikipedia-android-builds/">Wikipedia Android Alpha</a> from building properly. Now it builds properly whenever there is a new commit. Hooray! This was primarily caused by me forgetting to give it lots of RAM (8G VMEM) to execute the <code>mvn</code> build commands (<a href="https://gerrit.wikimedia.org/r/#/c/159482/">https://gerrit.wikimedia.org/r/#/c/159482/</a>) and also not cleaning up previous <code>.alpha</code> subfolders (<a href="https://gerrit.wikimedia.org/r/#/c/159481/">https://gerrit.wikimedia.org/r/#/c/159481/</a>) &#8211; this causes a chain of <code>.alpha.alpha.alpha.*</code> subfolders, breaking the build.</li>
<li>Added a <a href="https://gerrit.wikimedia.org/r/#/c/159506/">patch</a> to the Android alpha app itself that checks for updates every day or so and notifies you if there&#8217;s a new one. Was fairly trivial to write, although I was hoping to make it more seamless (i.e. download the apk myself and just pop it up for people to tap). It now requires 4 clicks to install it, should be able to bring it down to 2 at some point in the future if people care enough.</li>
<li>Added a method to our <code>check_graphite</code> code that lets you individually check a bunch of metrics for thresholds (<a href="https://gerrit.wikimedia.org/r/#/c/159473/">https://gerrit.wikimedia.org/r/#/c/159473/</a>). This makes it much simpler to do icinga checks on a bunch of metrics that are all measuring the same thing but from different machines. BetaLabs and ToolLabs checks use this.</li>
<li>Cleaned up a bunch of minor things with our <code>check_graphite</code> script. Also fucked up trying to replace all double quotes in it with single quotes for consistency &#8211; it replaced the double quotes being used inside single quotes, and caused all checks to fail. Fixed shortly by <a href="https://gerrit.wikimedia.org/r/#/c/159711/">https://gerrit.wikimedia.org/r/#/c/159711/</a></li>
<li>Added more monitoring for betalabs! Now checks for stale puppet runs (<a href="https://gerrit.wikimedia.org/r/#/c/159701/">https://gerrit.wikimedia.org/r/#/c/159701/</a>) and low space on the root partition (<a href="https://gerrit.wikimedia.org/r/#/c/159694/">https://gerrit.wikimedia.org/r/#/c/159694/</a>). All are green now, thanks to some work from bd808.</li>
<li>Added monitoring for ToolLabs! Now checks for stale puppet runs, low space on root and /var, and puppet failure events (<a href="https://gerrit.wikimedia.org/r/#/c/159709/">https://gerrit.wikimedia.org/r/#/c/159709/</a>). Also checks for high sustained CPU usage (<a href="https://gerrit.wikimedia.org/r/#/c/159751/">https://gerrit.wikimedia.org/r/#/c/159751/</a>). Then spent some time (with help from scfc_de (whose nick I kept spelling as scfe_de until today)) cleaning up the puppet failures. They are all green now as well.</li>
<li>Did a bunch of cleaning up work around the graphite role, removing the realm branching (<a href="https://gerrit.wikimedia.org/r/#/c/159759/">https://gerrit.wikimedia.org/r/#/c/159759/</a>). Ori says everytime realm branching code is removed, an angel gets its wings, so well done there.</li>
</ul>

<p>Not a bad day, eh? I&#8217;ve been trying to wake up early, perhaps that is helping.</p>

    <p>Missed DevLogging for a while.</p>

<p>Am in London now.</p>

<ul>
<li>Started using a spare <a href="http://www.keyboardco.com/keyboard/uk-filco-ninja-majestouch-2-tenkeyless-nkr-tactile-action-keyboard.asp">Majestouch Ninja 2</a> over my regular <a href="https://www.kinesis-ergo.com/shop/advantage-for-pc-mac/">Kinesis Advantage</a>. This is way more portable, and my hand does not seem to be hurting while using it (so far only about 4-5 hours). If this keeps up, I should be able to move to a similar smaller keyboard over the much bulkier kinesis. There&#8217;s still a little bit of discomfort, so I&#8217;ll probably want a very portable and mechanical split keyboard. Can&#8217;t sadly seem to find any, though :( Maybe I should just build one with an arduino :)</li>
<li>Setup icinga checks for puppet failures and disk space issues on betalabs, and fixed a bunch of issues/docs in our icinga puppet code during that time. This still doesn&#8217;t properly work since our implementation of <code>check_graphite</code> does not support wildcard metrics properly &#8211; it should check thresholds for each series, but it seems to do that only across the entire series combined, which is kinda useless. Should fix that soon by adding more features to it. Also might try out other alternatives to icinga, since our icinga puppet code is a fuckball anyway.</li>
<li>Fix a couple more Quarry bugs. There&#8217;s still a random bug where <code>celery</code> seems to be attempting to read data about a query run from mysql before the web has committed it, which is theoretically impossible (I do a commit before sending the task to celery with the id), so I suspect some mysql fuckery. Will need to debug that sooner than later, and also consider moving to <code>postgres</code>. But then Quarry will have to deal with SQLite (for result storage), MySQL (for connecting to labsdb) and with postgres for local data, which sounds insanely complex. I also added CORS support to resultsets, and Magnus is playing with it (wooohhooooo!!!). I&#8217;m going to add more features to make it easier for people to use results from quarry in their JS applications elsewhere. Should be fun.</li>
<li>Finished videos for the first week of the Coursera <a href="https://class.coursera.org/statistics-002">Data Analysis and Statistical Inference</a> class I&#8217;m taking. Started poking around R since the labs for that class are from R, should be fun.</li>
<li>Chad has started his <a href="http://anyonecanedit.org/blog">devlog</a>. He does search stuff at Wikimedia and is a co-whiner about all things Java. Do check out :)</li>
</ul>

<p>Am away on &#8216;vacation&#8217; till Wednesday, yay! :) Should disconnect well.</p>

    <p>Let&#8217;s see. I&#8217;m also going to attempt to include patch links wherever possible.</p>

<ul>
<li>Cleaned up <code>session</code> handling bugs in Quarry. They were previously not closing properly, causing SQLAlchemy exceptions now and then that&#8217;ll let queries die in a &#8216;queued&#8217; state. This should <em>hopefully</em> be fixed by <a href="https://gerrit.wikimedia.org/r/#/c/156909/">https://gerrit.wikimedia.org/r/#/c/156909/</a>.</li>
<li>Made <a href="https://graphite.wmflabs.org">https://graphite.wmflabs.org</a> somewhat more stable again for use by Wikimedia BetaLabs folks by just blacklisting all other projects from sending data to it (with a local whitelist hack + <a href="https://gerrit.wikimedia.org/r/#/c/156966/">https://gerrit.wikimedia.org/r/#/c/156966/</a>). This would let them use it, and they said they would find it massively useful. All this is a hack until <a href="https://rt.wikimedia.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=8163">https://rt.wikimedia.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=8163</a> could be resolved and I can deploy graphite on a &#8216;real&#8217; machine.</li>
<li>Minor patch to my Gerrit -&gt; IRC bot to make it strip a common prefix (&#8216;operations/&#8217;) from change messages posted to the operations channel &#8211; <a href="https://gerrit.wikimedia.org/r/#/c/156877/">https://gerrit.wikimedia.org/r/#/c/156877/</a>. Also made one that calls jenkins-bot jerkins-bot if it -1&#8217;s your patch (<a href="https://gerrit.wikimedia.org/r/#/c/156878/">https://gerrit.wikimedia.org/r/#/c/156878/</a>) but it seems to have a bug that I can&#8217;t be bothered to debug atm.</li>
</ul>

<p>Might spend some more time with Hive over the next few days &#8211; figured out an approach for using it from Python, and it should be fun to do so!</p>

    <p>Not very code heavy</p>

<ul>
<li>Couple of pull requests(<a href="https://github.com/atom/autosave/pull/22">#1</a> and <a href="https://github.com/atom/autosave/pull/21">#2</a>) for the <a href="https://github.com/atom/autosave">Atom Autosave plugin</a>. One adds a preference to not autosave by when you are explicitly closing a window / pane, and the other just sets the &#8216;enabled&#8217; preference to default. CoffeeScript isn&#8217;t too bad either! I should consider writing more plugins (I currently use Atom for CSS/JS/Puppet, should try other languages)</li>
<li>Added CSV, TSV and JSON download options to Quarry. There&#8217;s another Webinar tomorrow by the Grantmaking team, and J-Mo asked for it. Streaming TSV and CSV implemented in a neat way, will write a blog post tomorrow about it.</li>
<li>Started work on a &#8216;number of editors&#8217; per country metric for WPDMZ, needs to be finished up.</li>
</ul>

<p>I feel a bit exhausted (physically and mentally) from the intense coding over the last few weeks, might have a few chill days to recharge myself. I&#8217;m growing old! :(</p>

    <p>Wooooo!</p>

<ul>
<li>Moved <a href="https://github.com/yuvipanda/labsbooks">labsbooks</a> (described in <a href="http://yuvi.in/blog/devlog-23-aug-2014/">yesterday&#8217;s devlog</a>) to use a shared readonly IPython virtualenv maintained by me. Also installed a bunch of modules people might want to use (SciPy, NumPy, Pandas, PyTables, matplotlib). Am considering just installing IPython notebook globally via puppet and using that, since that&#8217;ll enable users to just use the system packages. However, the version of IPython notebook from Ubuntu is ancient, so that&#8217;s probably a non-starter.</li>
<li>Have a basic version of the IPython publishing process working! Any toollabs user can create a notebook by:

<ul>
<li>Creating a <code>~/notebooks</code> folder</li>
<li>Doing a <code>chmod +x ~/notebooks</code></li>
<li>Doing a <code>chmod +x ~</code></li>
<li>Putting IPython notebooks into <code>~/notebooks</code> (as <code>.ipynb</code>) files</li>
<li>Going to <code>https://tools.wmflabs.org/notebooks/&lt;user-shell-name&gt;/&lt;path-to-ipynb-file&gt;</code> Will have to do a bit more work before it can be considered &#8216;production grade&#8217; (such as user pages, a nicer theme, etc, etc) BUT YAY GOOD START. It already caches the html output in Redis and invalidates with the <code>mtime</code> of the file, so should be pretty quick.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Made the ssh tunneling process for <code>labsbooks</code> purely python, without requiring the <code>ProxyCommand</code>. This makes things simpler (and more portable!). I&#8217;ll need to work on securing this properly before I can publish it for broader use.</li>
<li>Wrote <a href="https://lists.wikimedia.org/pipermail/analytics/2014-August/002437.html">an email</a> to the analytics mailing list about making public the &#8216;edits per country&#8217; data. I hope to make this publicly available with enough granularity that not just me but others can use this for fun research as well.</li>
</ul>

<p>I&#8217;ve been using <a href="https://atom.io">Atom</a> for puppet stuff, <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/">PyCharm</a> for Python and <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/">IntelliJ</a> for Java stuff, and that seems to be doing ok. They all have decent Vim keybindings as well, and good replacements for other functionality &#8211; and I might stick with Atom for a while to see how it goes :)</p>

    <span class="post-date">Sun, Aug 24, 2014</span>

    <p>Back in Glasgow! It was actually not very cold today, only cold! Progress.</p>

<p>Started working on my long-abandoned <code>labsbook</code> project, which aims to make <a href="https://tools.wmflabs.org">Tool Labs</a> a first class environment for people who want to run (and publish) <a href="http://ipython.org/notebook.html">iPython Notebooks</a> while also being able to access the replica databases and the dumps. Doing this in a secure manner is kinda hard, but I think I&#8217;ve a neat solution that lets everyone run a personal iPython kernel on the Grid, access it from their local machine, and also publish it to the web from a standard location. So far, I&#8217;ve gotten my script to a point where it&#8217;ll setup an iPython environment for you if it doesn&#8217;t already exist, start the kernel if it isn&#8217;t already running, and tunnel the editing interface back to you to use! Things left to do include:</p>

<ol>
<li>Open up the browser when tunnel is open</li>
<li>Find a sane way to kill a kernel that hasn&#8217;t been doing anything since forever</li>
<li>Setup a shared iPython environment (just code, readonly) so people don&#8217;t have to setup their own environments everytime (this is primarily a performance enhancement)</li>
<li>Find a nice and simple way for iPython notebooks to be published. I&#8217;m currently thinking of an URL such as <code>tools.wmflabs.org/notebooks/&lt;username&gt;/&lt;notebookname&gt;' to display them, and an index at</code>tools.wmflabs.org/notebooks/<username>`. This shouldn&#8217;t be too hard with appropriate permission munging.</li>
</ol>

<p>I&#8217;m also using <a href="http://www.paramiko.org/">paramiko</a> for this, which makes writing SSH related code with Python a breeze. It even supports <code>proxycommand</code>! Blunders I&#8217;ve done while getting up to this point include:</p>

<ol>
<li>Running <code>jsub run.bash -mem 4G</code> instead of <code>jsub -mem 4G run.bash</code> and wondering why my script kept getting killed with OOM.</li>
<li>Trying to do a <code>pip install</code> on the Grid nodes (which don&#8217;t have build tools) instead of on <code>tools-dev</code> and wondering why running it from the commandline works but from <code>jsub</code> does not.</li>
<li>Wondering why my SSH Tunnel kept dying and trying to debug that without realizing that it was dying because the iPython process was dying because it was OOMing because of my earlier <code>jsub</code> error</li>
<li>Thinking that user accounts (rather than tool accounts) can not submit jobs to the grid, while the problem was that I had not set the <code>execute</code> bit on my script.</li>
</ol>

<p>Once this is done (I suspect tomorrow), I&#8217;ll work on getting the data from my work with <a href="https://github.com/Ironholds/WPDMZ">WPDMZ</a> into a form good enough for publicizing (removing ways of de-anonymization), and then use iPython notebooks to make graphs! This should be fun :)</p>

<p>Source so far available <a href="https://github.com/yuvipanda/labsbooks">on Github</a>. Needs more work / documentation / cleaning up.</p>

    <p>Was in Edinburgh again, missed writing it as I went along. Oh well.</p>

<ul>
<li>Ported the code for the Wikipedia Android app automated builds to Python, and you can see it in action at <a href="http://tools.wmflabs.org/wikipedia-android-builds/">http://tools.wmflabs.org/wikipedia-android-builds/</a> now. It lets you download the latest build, and notes the last successful build time. Good enough :) It was originally in bash, and porting it to python allowed me to create a &#8216;fake&#8217; API (just JSON blobs written to known locations in the file system). Next step is to write a helper app</li>
<li>The Atom experiment is coming along well. Am using it for most of my Puppet work these days. Should give LightTable another go as well.</li>

    <p>In Edinburgh! I&#8217;ve finally stopped spelling it as Edinborough!</p>

<ul>
<li>Added &#8216;user group&#8217; functionality to Quarry, and added a <code>sudo</code> user group that does what you would think it does. Will be assigned super, super sparingly.</li>
<li>Found out that I&#8217;d have to explicitly specify charset of the database when I&#8217;m creating it or MySQL will default to a stupid charset. Forced all tables and columns to utf8 and that seems to have fixed a bunch of unicode issues. Yay?</li>
<li>Still facing occasional <code>MySQL server has gone away</code> errors with SQLAlchemy for local MySQL instance, despite asking SQLAlchemy to recycle connections every hour or so. Reduced the recycle time to 10m, hopefully that helps.</li>
<li>Read Tony Hoare&#8217;s Turing Award speech from 1980, titled <a href="http://zoo.cs.yale.edu/classes/cs422/2014/bib/hoare81emperor.pdf">&#8220;The Emperor&#8217;s Old Clothes&#8221;</a>. I think I should read more of these papers / speeches, helps keep perspective and &#8216;learn from history&#8217;. Lots of warnings against complexity seem to be a very common theme, and one I&#8217;ve also personally encountered many times. Recommend reading :)</li>
<li>More DMZ work! Now running edits per country stats separated by mobile vs desktop for all countries for all wikipedias! EXCITING!</li>

    <p>Woke up at 11AM again! w000t!</p>

<ul>
<li>Fixed a stupid bug in Quarry that made it fail if MySQL decided that a column you were selecting is a <code>Decimal</code>. Fixed this in time for&#8230;</li>
<li>Helped out with a <a href="https://plus.google.com/u/0/b/117126229120807344920/events/cngcjcmm1tcn1omqpalcm686044">webinar</a> from J-Mo for people to learn SQL and do research against Wikimedia stuff with Quarry! Went without a glitch mostly, so yay :) Oren asked for an API for Quarry, I&#8217;ll investigate ways to get that done</li>
<li>Found that some queries against enwiki succeed on <code>s1.labsdb</code> but not on <code>s4.labsdb</code>. I attribute this to cache characteristics, and have switched Quarry to use s1 for now.</li>
<li>Did more work on <a href="https://github.com/Ironholds/WPDMZ">DMZ</a>, getting in place a runner / processor infrastructure and sqlite backed intermediary storage so I can write simpler code to get the data I want. Super excited to see how this goes. It&#8217;ll be much easier for me to add new queries now.</li>
<li>More work on DMZ! I had a late night sprint and split edits by mobile and desktop (and was surprised by seeing how much lesser edits came from mobile). Next would be to gather up population and internet penetration data and then GO MAKE SOME GRAPHS, probably with iPython. I&#8217;m returning to making graphs for real after, what, 6 years or so? :) I was using C# and Excel then :) /nick ExcitedPanda</li>
<li>Also made some progress on our makeshift Android CI-ish build system for the Wikipedia app. Should be done soon.</li>

    <p>Here we go again.</p>

<ul>
<li>Wrote <a href="http://yuvi.in/blog/simple-python-packaging-debian-ubuntu/">a small blog post</a> talking about how to package python packages as debian packages.</li>
<li>More work on getting <a href="https://graphite.readthedocs.org/en/latest/">Graphite</a> setup for Wikimedia Labs. Everything is up and running now (after a number of embarrassing typos). Need to figure out NAT rules to let labs machines talk to <code>labmon1001</code>, and then it can start receiving data!!!1</li>
<li>Got access to Wikimedia&#8217;s <a href="http://hadoop.apache.org/">Hadoop</a> cluster, and ran my first <a href="https://hive.apache.org/">HIVE</a> query ever! This is exciting :)</li>
<li>Made packages for <a href="https://github.com/appliedsec/pygeoip">pygeoip</a> and <a href="https://github.com/tobie/ua-parser">ua-parser</a>. Having to make both trusty and precise packages was fun. I ended up building them on separate machines, but am sure there&#8217;s a simpler way.</li>
<li>Started doing some SQL about editors from different countries. Did you know that there are 2x as many edits to english wikipedia from India as from Germany? And that Wikidata has had 10x as many edits from Toollabs as from Germany (the largest contributing country)? I didn&#8217;t either! This is fun.</li>

        Simple python packaging for Debian / Ubuntu
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">Tue, Aug 19, 2014</span>

    <p>(As requested by <a href="https://twitter.com/JeanFred">Jean-Fred</a>)</p>

<p>One of the &#8216;pain points&#8217; with working on deploying python stuff at Wikimedia is that <code>pip</code> and <code>virtualenvs</code> are banned on production, for some (what I now understand as) good reasons (the solid Signing / Security issues with PYPI, and the slightly less solid but nonetheless valid &#8216;If we use pip for python and gem for ruby and npm for node, EXPLOSION OF PACKAGE MANAGERS and makes things harder to manage&#8217;). I was whining about how hard debian packaging was for quite a while without checking how easy/hard it was to package python specifically, and when I finally did, it turned out to be quite not that hard.</p>

<p>Use <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/stdeb">python-stdeb</a>.</p>

<p>Really, that is it. Ignore most other things (until you run into issues that require them :P). It can translate most python packages that are packaged for PyPI into .debs that mostly pass <a href="https://lintian.debian.org/">lintian</a> checks. Simplest way to package, that I&#8217;ve been following for a while is:</p>

<ol>
<li>Install <code>python-stdeb</code> (from pip or apt). Usually requires the packages <code>python-all</code>, <code>fakeroot</code> and <code>build-essential</code>, although for some reason these aren&#8217;t required by the debian package for <code>stdeb</code>. Make sure you&#8217;re on the same distro you are building the package for.</li>
<li><code>git clone</code> the package from its source</li>
<li>Run <code>python setup.py --command-packages=stdeb.command bdist_deb</code> (or <code>python3</code> if you want to make Python 3 package)</li>
<li>Run <code>lintian</code> on it. If it spots errors, go back and fix them, usually by editing the <code>setup.py</code> file (or sometimes a <code>stdeb.cfg</code> file). This is usually rather obvious and easy enough to fix.</li>
<li>Run <code>dpkg -i &lt;package&gt;</code> to try to install the package. This will error out if it can&#8217;t find the packages that your package depends on. This means that they haven&#8217;t been packaged for debian yet. You can mostly fix this by finding that package, and making a deb for it, and installing it as well (recursively making debs for packages as you need them). While this sounds onerous, the fact is that most python packages already exist as deb packages and you <code>stdeb</code> will just work for them. You might have to do this more if you&#8217;re packaging for an older distro (<em>cough</em> <em>cough</em> <code>precise</code> <em>cough</em> <em>cough</em>), but is much easier on newer distros.</li>
<li>Put your package in a repository! If you want to use this on Wikimedia Labs, you should use <a href="https://wikitech.wikimedia.org/wiki/Help:Using_debs_in_labs">Labsdebrepo</a>. Other environments will have similar ways to make the package available via <code>apt-get</code>. Avoid the temptation to just <code>dpkg -i</code> it on machines manually :)</li>
</ol>

<p>That&#8217;s pretty much it! Much simpler than I originally expected, and not much confusing / conflicting docs. The docs for <code>stdeb</code> are pretty nice and complete, so do read these!</p>

<p>Will update the post as I learn more.</p>

    <span class="post-date">Mon, Aug 18, 2014</span>

    <p>I&#8217;ve started paying for <a href="https://irccloud.com">IRCCloud</a>.</p>

<p>It is the first &#8216;service&#8217; I am paying for as a subscriber, I think. I&#8217;ve considered doing that for a long time, but &#8216;paying for IRC&#8217; just felt&#8230; odd. I&#8217;ve been using <a href="http://wiki.znc.in/ZNC">ZNC</a> + <a href="http://limechat.net/mac/">LimeChat</a>. It&#8217;s decent, but sucks on Mobile. Keeping a socket open all the time on a phone just kills the battery, plus the UX on most Android clients sucks.</p>

<p>So after seeing <a href="http://samsmith.io/">Sam Smith</a> use IRCCloud during Wikimania, I made the plunge and paid for IRCCloud. It is still connecting to my bouncer, so I have logs under my control. It also has a very usable Android client, and syncs &#8216;read&#8217; status across devices, and is quite fast.</p>

<p>Convenience and UX won over &#8216;Free Software&#8217; this time.</p>

    <p>I&#8217;ve started the habit of opening up a devlog post each morning and just filling it up as I go along. Let&#8217;s hope I can keep this up :)</p>

<ul>
<li>Merged a couple of Android patches. The app is getting better every day without too much involvement from me, and yay for that :) I&#8217;ve gotten closure over the Android app &#8211; it was fucking terrible, and now it is quite awesome. Need to write another post about that.</li>
<li>Fixed annoying bug with mysql connections being reset in Quarry&#8217;s query runners after a few hours. I had fixed this earlier when I was using <code>pymysql</code> directly with reconnect(ping=True), and assumed that switching to <a href="http://www.sqlalchemy.org/">SQLAlchemy</a> would&#8217;ve fixed it for me automagically. <a href="http://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/latest/faq.html#mysql-server-has-gone-away">Apparently not</a>. MySQL Y U SO BAD?</li>
<li>I have <code>sudo</code> access on <code>labmon1001</code> in prod! First Wikimedia production cluster machine I have root on, and will spend time over the next few weeks setting it up to run graphite. Should be fun!</li>
<li>Getting slightly better at packaging python things. Packaged <a href="https://github.com/sidnei/txstatsd">python-txstatsd</a> with no lintian errors, and only a couple warnings :)</li>

    <p>Devlogs again! Let&#8217;s see how long I can keep this one up.</p>

<p>Been a whirlwind few months. I&#8217;m moving to the Wikimedia Ops team soon! The Wikipedia app has been released! Lots of excitement around, should do a bigger post sometime with details. This should just follow usual devlog format of stuff for the day</p>

<ul>
<li>Completed deployment of changing the results backend of <a href="https://quarry.wmflabs.org">Quarry</a> to SQLite. That was a fun exercise, and I should write about that separately. Still have some unicode issues left (mostly from the MySQL side) that I&#8217;ve hacked around for now.</li>
<li>Quarry now uses a cron based query killer instead of relying on Celery. The day before I had force killed the celery deamons and this meant the query kill tasks didn&#8217;t run, leaving zombie queries behind. The simpler cron based killer won&#8217;t have this issue, since it&#8217;s super simple and does only one thing. The only reason I didn&#8217;t do this before was that I had not known about <code>SHOW PROCESSLIST</code> before (yes, I suck). It seems to be working fine now, but doesn&#8217;t kill superseeded queries immediately. Should be interesting to figure out how to get that done properly.</li>
<li>I&#8217;ve started trying out <a href="https://atom.io">Atom</a> again. My previous attempt ended quickly when I ran into a bug which didn&#8217;t wrap text at all. A restart seems to have fixed that. The Vim keybindings are &#8216;ok&#8217; &#8211; there&#8217;s no <code>hlsearch</code>, which is painful, but I can live with it. I prefer the fuzzy finder in it to Ctrl-P in Vim.</li>
<li>Started working on making labs monitoring with graphite possible again. Our graphite / txstatsd roles weren&#8217;t meant to be run on trusty, so working on porting things to make sure they work fine on both. I&#8217;ve immensely come to appreciate ops over the last year or so, and am quite enjoying my work in that area :) I&#8217;ll probably be doing more of these over the next week, since Quarry has reached a nice state now and I await more usage before I spend more time on it.</li>
<li>Also did some code review on the Android app. It&#8217;s been chugging along quite happily these days :)</li>
<li>Ran into a awake-when-he-should-not-have been <a href="http://blog.ironholds.org/">Oliver Keyes</a> and we have conspired to start some <a href="https://etherpad.wikimedia.org/p/flagellating-funnel">researchy</a> <a href="https://github.com/Ironholds/WPDMZ">things</a>. I cleaned up some of the python code, and am writing out things to do. This should be fun!</li>

<p>Hi girls, first you say &lsquo;how are you?&rsquo;
After knowing me for 10 months you say
&lsquo;Who are you?&rsquo;
Just three words &lsquo;I love you&rsquo;
Don&rsquo;t you even know the meaning of that?</p>

<p>Hey Sheena, Leena, Meena, Veena,
Don&rsquo;t show off as knowing only little bits
of tamil with a foreign accent,
If you leave Tamil Nadu and go out,
does not mean you have to forget your mother tongue Tamil</p>

<p>Rohini, Yohini, Yamini, Kamini,
Think they are hot but are actually funny,
Don&rsquo;t blame men pointlessly,
(He is looking at me only!) Why do you do this?</p>

What the fuck is happening in Tamil Nadu
I salute you all
All your honor is flying away</p>

All your honor is flying away</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not blaming all women,
The deity who gave birth to me is also a woman.
All the guys come to my side,
or these girls will spoil you as well</p>

<p>Of 100, 50 are like these,
Roaming around clubs drinking and smoking,
From the time when women cooked nice food,
OH MY GOD NOW THEY ARE SMOOKING GANJA WHAT A SHAME</p>

<p>Women roaming around drunk in clubs
What the fuck is happening in Tamil Nadu
I salute you all
All your honor is flying away</p>

<p>Women roaming around drunk in clubs
What the fuck is happening in Tamil Nadu
I salute you all
All your honor is flying away</p>

<p>Pretty woman, with pretty eyes
BUT SHE HAS ONE BOTTLE OF RUM!</p>

<p>Pretty woman, with pretty eyes,
BUT WITH RUM SHE HAS HALF A PACK OF CIGARETTES</p>

<p>Pretty fairy, I don&rsquo;t need you,
You are dancing heavily drunk.</p>

<p>Gone are the times when women wore jewellery,
Now they keep smoking everywhere.
Instead of wearing sarees,
THEY ARE WEARING HANDKERCHEIFS!</p>

<p>And then a few days later I realized that it is talking about &#8216;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scouting_for_Boys">the book</a>&#8216;.

    <p><a href="http://git-scm.com/book/en/">Pro Git</a> is a nice book I recommend to newbies &#8211; yet I hadn&#8217;t fully read it once. I decided to do so, and I think it was reasonably useful. Most of the stuff in here I already knew, and the treatment of the stuff I did not (Git Internals, mostly) wasn&#8217;t deep enough to be useful. Nevertheless, reinforced some useful concepts in my head and probably gave me enough strong foundations for when I decide to dive into the actual internals of git more (probably by reading the source code?). Also looked very newbie friendly, so I&#8217;ll continue recommending this to people who want to learn about Git.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Write once, attempt to debug everywhere&#8221; is probably way more accurate than &#8220;Write once, run anywhere&#8221; &#8211; at least for GUI apps. There&#8217;s something rather special about ideas that are theoretically amazingly wonderful yet end up being a major pain in the butt when you try to put them in practice, isn&#8217;t it?</p>

<p>The older <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.wikipedia">Wikipedia App</a> happened to be in <a href="http://phonegap.com/">PhoneGap</a>, and I consider it one of my biggest blunders to not have torn it down on day 0 and rewritten it in something saner. I once started writing a blog post for the <a href="https://blog.wikimedia.org">Wikimedia Blog</a> about why we switched from PhoneGap to native apps, but it was killed for having too much profanity in it :) Someday, perhaps.</p>

      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">Tue, Sep 24, 2013</span>

    <p>I&#8217;ve given up on trying to make DevLogs really comprehensive and complete, and just try to make them &#8211; even if they are incomplete. Perhaps this will help me actually write more devlogs, and thus make it more comprehensive&#8230;</p>

<p>I started on the <a href="https://www.coursera.org/course/progfun">Functional Programming in Scala</a> course today. I wanted to do it the last time, but did not find the time. This time will be different &#8211; I&#8217;m in a different spot mentally, and a big drain on my emotional / time resources (&#8220;college&#8221;) is no longer a factor. I&#8217;ve already gone through the first week&#8217;s lectures (most seem straight ports from <a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/">SICP</a>), and am <sup>2</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub> of my way through the assignments for the first week. Though I&#8217;m normally not fond of the typical types of exercises (&#8220;How many ways can you make change for this scenario?&#8221;), doing them functionally seems to be enough of a twist to keep me interested. The regular languages I seem to work with these days (Java, PHP, Puppet, Python and a bit of JS) aren&#8217;t exactly well tuned to the functional style of programming (except JS, but I don&#8217;t really do that much JS these days) &#8211; so going through this course and hopefully building something in Scala can exercise my &#8216;OMG HOLY SHIT THIS NEW THING IS AWESOME!!1&#8217; muscles.</p>

<p>The course recommends using Scala IDE. Which is Eclipse based. Despite my deep distaste for Eclipse, I&#8217;ve given it a shot and it seems fairly stable and much less shitty than the Eclipse I&#8217;m used to! Let&#8217;s see how that goes.</p>

<p>The way I learn the best seems to be to find a project I want to build, and then build it in a new language. I&#8217;m looking around for fun projects that I could build with Scala, and I&#8217;m pretty sure I&#8217;ll find one at some point. I should also try to diversify the communities I contribute to, so perhaps I should look for a non-Wikimedia project where I can contribute to in Scala. Should be fun :D</p>

<p>Other than that &#8211; I&#8217;ve been <a href="https://bugzilla.wikimedia.org/show_bug.cgi?id=54465">investigating performance problems</a> with the Campaigns API &#8211; turns out Mediawiki&#8217;s Parser is really, really slow. Who would&#8217;ve thought, eh? ;). The &#8216;solution&#8217;, of course &#8211; is to just add more caching. Which is a sortof biggish, hairy-ish problem because of the number of changes that can cause cache invalidation. The way Mediawiki handles caching is&#8230; rather complex &#8211; but that is more due to how much functionality exists rather than anything else. Needs a proper &#8216;clean&#8217; solution that is not just &#8220;Let&#8217;s cache everything for 5 minutes!!!1&#8221;. Should be fun to write up and fix!</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve also been spending time integrating <a href="https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/MediaWiki-Vagrant">Mediawiki-Vagrant</a> with <a href="https://wikitech.wikimedia.org">Wikimedia Labs</a>. This will make it easy for anyone to setup a base mediawiki installation on Labs, and save time dicking around various mundane deployment-of-test-instance issues (did I turn on caching? How do I get this extension on? etc). This is interesting because it merges two different puppet repos &#8211; operations/puppet.git and mediawiki/vagrant.git on one machine and provides different ways of managing them. Since this is also using puppet as a sort of &#8216;deployment&#8217; tool (rather than just a configuration-of-systems tool), that is an interesting / fun aspect too. Should be able to get the <a href="https://gerrit.wikimedia.org/r/#/c/85814/">patch</a> merged in a few weeks.</p>

<p>I visited San Francisco for the last 2 weeks. I don&#8217;t really feel insecure anymore :)</p>

    <p>[Warning: Childish rant ahead]</p>

<p>My natural sleep cycle seems to be one that tends towards the darker times &#8211; sleeping before 3AM feels like an abomination, before midnight unheard of. My best work seems to be done between 2AM and 5AM. My current &lsquo;sleep cycle&rsquo; has me sleeping at about 8AM, and waking up at about 5PM. Plenty of sleep for the day, eh?</p>

<p>It is probably not healthy. I don&rsquo;t look, or feel healthy. But that is the way it is.</p>

<p>SO IT FUCKING SUCKS WHEN THE POWER GOES OUT AT MIDNIGHT, BECAUSE I HAD JUST STARTED GETTING SHIT DONE. AND THEN YOUR PHONE REFUSES TO TETHER INTERNET, BECAUSE FUCKING ASSHOLES. AND THEN THE POWER COMES BACK AFTER THREE FUCKING HOURS AND YOU STILL CAN NOT GET ON THE INTERNET BECAUSE THE FUCKING LINE IS DEAD. IT IS MIDNIGHT AND YOU ARE IN FUCKING CHENNAI SO YOU CAN NOT EVEN GET THE FUCK OUT OF THIS PRISON. YOU CAN NOT SLEEP BECAUSE YOU JUST WOKE UP. FUCK THIS SHIT.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m scarily addicted to the internet. All my friends are there.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t understand how ad-blocking is even legal. It&rsquo;s like stealing &#8211; stealing content for free, IMHO there&rsquo;s no difference between stealing MP3s and news or any other content. There&rsquo;s some kind of user agreement between websites and its users &#8211; &ldquo;you can use our site for free, but you have to watch the ads&rdquo;. Adblock violates this agreement. The people responsible for this should be in prison, they&rsquo;re thieves. And I&rsquo;m pretty sure the time will come they will.</p>

<p>DevLogs have been something I&rsquo;ve not been writing much of of late. Time to fix that!</p>

<h2 id="wlm-android-app">WLM Android App</h2>

<p>Spent some time <a href="http://lists.wikimedia.org/pipermail/wikilovesmonuments/2013-August/006249.html">reviving the WLM Android App</a>. Wasn&rsquo;t too hard, and am surprised at how well it still runs :) Some work still needed to update the <a href="https://github.com/wikimedia/WLMMobile/commit/113d9abf7b675b147ece3f2be005ef1b6ba0e4cf#assets/www/js/campaigns-data.js">templates</a> and other metadata to refer to WLM2013 rather than WLM2012 &#8211; but that should not be too hard. The fact that it is an issue at all is simply because I ripped out all the Campaign related APIs a few weeks ago with my UploadCampaign rewrite.</p>

<p><a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/User:Multichill">multichill</a> was awesome in moving the <a href="https://tools.wmflabs.org/heritage/api/api.php">Monuments API</a> to <a href="https://tools.wmflabs.org">Tool Labs</a> &#8211; hence making it much faster! Initially we thought that the Toollabs DB was too slow for writes &#8211; but this turned out to be a mistake, since apparently the Replica Databases had slow writes, but <code>tools-db</code> itself was fine. There&rsquo;s <a href="https://bugzilla.wikimedia.org/show_bug.cgi?id=48851">a bug</a> tracking this now. Toollabs version of the API still seems much faster to me than Toolserver&rsquo;s :)</p>

<h2 id="uploadcampaigns-api">UploadCampaigns API</h2>

<p>Mediawiki sucks. Eeeew! Specifically, writing API modules &#8211; why can&rsquo;t we just be happy and have everything be JSON? Sigh!</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m adding <a href="https://gerrit.wikimedia.org/r/#/c/80782/">a patch</a> that allows <a href="https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:UploadWizard/Campaigns">UploadCampaigns</a> to be queried selectively, rather than just via the normal page APIs. Right now, this only lets us filter by <code>enabled</code> status &#8211; but in the future, this should be able to also filter on a vast array of other properties. Properties about Geographic location come to mind as the most useful. That patch still has a good way to go before it can be merged (continue support being the foremost one), but it is getting there :)</p>

<p>The ickiest part of the patch is perhaps that it sends out raw JSON data as a&#8230; string. So no matter which format you are using on your client, you <em>need</em> to use a JSON parser to deal with the Campaigns data. This sortof makes sense, since that is how the data is stored anyway. Doesn&rsquo;t make it any less icky, though!</p>

<p>Not bad for a lazy Sunday, eh?</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: After not being able to sleep, I also submitted <a href="https://gerrit.wikimedia.org/r/#/c/80946/">a patch</a> to make phpcs pass for UploadWizard, and also fought with the UploadCampaigns API patch to have it (brokenly?) support continuing. Yay?</p>

    <span class="post-date">Sat, Aug 24, 2013</span>

    <p>I&rsquo;ve been on the Internet since I was 14. And I don&rsquo;t remember a time when I did not have a computer &#8211; I think I got mine when I was 10. Growing up, writing code has always been a major part of me &#8211; my identity. I&rsquo;ve never quite managed to separate &lsquo;me&rsquo; from &lsquo;my code&rsquo; &#8211; despite mouthing off the soundbite &lsquo;You are not your code!&rsquo; to plenty of people.</p>

<p>After Wikimania 2013, I spent a week in Hong Kong. The first few days were rough, but after that &#8211; it was amazing. For the first time I could imagine, I had completely managed to not think about code at all! I had my laptop locked in a locker somewhere, and didn&rsquo;t even bother getting to it. I didn&rsquo;t feel the burning urge to make a commit. The feeling of guilt that keeps gnawing at you from the back of the head &lsquo;teehee you have been so unproductive today!&rsquo;.</p>

<p>That was a rather great feeling. Put things into a little bit more perspective. A step towards separating my identity from my code. I gave up on my GitHub streaks after that. I&rsquo;ll probably also be less of a codeaholic.</p>

<p>I could write about &lsquo;oh my god, this was amazing!&rsquo; and detail where I travelled in Hong Kong, but I think what was far more fascinating was <em>how</em>. I did not feel in a hurry. Did not feel like having to &lsquo;tick all boxes&rsquo; before leaving. Just&#8230; actually relaxing. And doing whatever.</p>

<p>Vacations are good :)</p>

    <p>After being frustrated at Java&rsquo;s lack of a generic &lsquo;callback&rsquo; type, I created this interface:</p>

<pre><code>    public interface ContributionUploadProgress {
        void onUploadStarted(Contribution contribution);
        boolean isJavaAPieceOfShit();
    }
</code></pre>

<p>And randomly throw around (with <code>onComplete</code> implementing <code>ContributionUploadProgress</code>)</p>

<pre><code>    assert onComplete.isJavaAPieceOfShit();
</code></pre>

<p>This, of course, is trivial to fix with an IDE. Should be more fun with a dynamic language :)</p>

<p>(And yes, I removed that code before committing)</p>

    <p>I&rsquo;m on my <a href="https://github.com/yuvipanda">longest</a> GitHub Streak this year &#8211; currently 20 days (was previously 18 days). That means I&rsquo;ve had at least one commit (though usually more!) each day for the last 20 days. Sounds much easier than it actually is. Wanting to keep my streak unbroken is also making me write more diverse code &#8211; I think those 20 days feature code in Javascript, Python, Java, PHP and Python. It&rsquo;s also distributed across a lot of projects &#8211; at least 8-9 different ones on last count. Streaks are helping me a fair bit! Getting the first commit of the day is the hardest &#8211; seems to get easier to keep things after.</p>

<p>So I&rsquo;ve beat my previous streak length for this year (18 days). Next step would be to get over the awesome/scarily productive <a href="https://github.com/legoktm">legoktm</a>&rsquo;s longest streak (29 days). Eventual goal would be to match <a href="https://github.com/atdt">ori-l</a> at some point in productivity.</p>

        Attempting to Secure Redis in a Multi Tenant environment
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">Sat, Jul 20, 2013</span>

    

<p>When running <a href="http://redis.io/">Redis</a> in a shared cluster/hosting environment (such as <a href="https://wikitech.wikimedia.org/wiki/Nova_Resource:Tools/Help">Wikimedia Tool Labs</a>, on which I&rsquo;ve been having fun doing a lot of work on), you would want to try to provide at least <em>some</em> guarantee of isolation for your keys from everyone else&rsquo;s keys. Since Redis doesn&rsquo;t do ACLs, this is problematic.</p>

<p>This can be solved in a couple of ways</p>

<h2 id="run-a-redis-instance-for-each-user">Run a Redis instance for each user</h2>

<p>This is simple enough to do &#8211; each user runs their own Redis instance, and has full access to it. Security is handled by setting a secret password, and running <code>redis-server</code> as the user in question. Boom, secure!</p>

<p>This doesn&rsquo;t really scale with a large number of users, because they each have lesser memory to work with now. Also having users who just want to run their tools have to deal with making sure their Redis instance is up and running fine isn&rsquo;t really good. Having the sysadmins be responsible for users&rsquo; Redis instance is&#8230; not going to work :) This would also require all the redis instances to run on one box and/or have a separate cluster just for them, which isn&rsquo;t good either.</p>

<h2 id="add-acl-support-to-redis">Add ACL support to Redis</h2>

<p>Not happening, because I&rsquo;m not good enough to do that yet :P But more realistically, it won&rsquo;t ever happen, since this will probably add a lot of overhead for what is arguably an edge case.</p>

<h2 id="build-a-small-server-that-sits-in-front-of-redis">Build a small server that sits in front of Redis</h2>

<p>Such a server would simply authenticate incoming requests via some mechanism (<a href="http://keystone.openstack.org/">Keystone</a> perhaps), and then enforce ACLs. It will have to speak the exact same protocol as Redis, since users should be able to use any library that connects to Redis. This isn&rsquo;t too hard &#8211; just replace the <code>password</code> functionality of Redis protocol to take in both a username and password (or token, or some other method of auth).</p>

<p>This also I discarded &#8211; it will still affect performance, which will now be limited by how fast <em>this</em> server runs, and that is definitely not faster than Redis. And it will also be hard to maintain, since I&rsquo;ll have to completely mimic Redis&rsquo; protocol and make sure it is kept up to date. Debugging protocol issues with random client libraries is not my idea of fun. Another <strong>major</strong> disadvantage is that <strong>I</strong> would now be writing auth code, and I don&rsquo;t think handrolling auth code is a good idea, ever.</p>

<h2 id="security-by-obscurity">Security By Obscurity!</h2>

<p>This is what we finally settled on :D It sounds horrible by the title, but I think it is Good Enough<sup>TM</sup>.</p>

<p>Since Redis is a key value store at heart, you can do anything once you know the key. So, if an &lsquo;attacker&rsquo; doesn&rsquo;t know the key, there isn&rsquo;t much they can do. So it can be considered SecureEnough for our purposes if we can make it so that other users can not find out or guess your keys.</p>

<p>We essentially did so with the following:</p>

<ol>
<li>Disable all Redis commands that let users list all / many keys.</li>
<li>Have users use a random and long key prefix for all their keys.</li>
</ol>

<p>(1) prevents someone from just listing all keys to find something interesting. (2) prevents people from brute-forcing or guessing keys. Since all code run on Tool Labs must be open source, guessing keys is super easy. By having a &lsquo;secret&rsquo; prefix, having the actual keys is useless. This also prevents accidental key overwrites from different tools using a common key name.</p>

<p>Disabling commands is easy to do by using Redis&rsquo; <code>RENAME COMMAND</code> config feature. I added support for <code>RENAME COMMAND</code> to Wikimedia&rsquo;s <a href="https://github.com/wikimedia/operations-puppet/tree/production/modules/redis">Redis puppet module</a>, and then it was simple enough to <a href="https://github.com/wikimedia/operations-puppet/blob/production/modules/toollabs/manifests/redis.pp">configure</a> a specific instance to disable &lsquo;list keys&rsquo; type commands. That&rsquo;s the following commands:</p>

<ol>
<li><code>CONFIG</code></li>
<li><code>FLUSHALL</code></li>
<li><code>FLUSHDB</code></li>
<li><code>KEYS</code></li>
<li><code>SHUTDOWN</code></li>
<li><code>SLAVEOF</code></li>
<li><code>CLIENT</code></li>
<li><code>RANDOMKEY</code></li>
<li><code>DEBUG</code>.</li>
</ol>

<p>After going through the list of Redis commands, I am guessing this is going to be GoodEnough to prevent key listing. (Note: if there&rsquo;s more that I&rsquo;m missing, please, <em>please</em> let me know).</p>

<p>We also tell people to use a secure prefix that&rsquo;s at least 64bytes long, saved in a file that is only user readable. Generating that is as simple as:</p>

<p>openssl rand -base64 64</p>

<p>That should be long enough to be hard to brute force, even with Redis being as fast as it is.</p>

<h3 id="problems">Problems</h3>

<p>The major problem with this is, of course &#8211; the fact that humans are involved :) I&rsquo;ve heard &ldquo;I do not care about my keys, do not need security&rdquo; a fair amount of times already. The fact that the prefix generation is optional means that there will be people who do not use prefixes, and it will work for them for a (probably) long time &#8211; until it doesn&rsquo;t, and they have no idea why. This is personally acceptable to me, since they have been made aware of the risks beforehand.</p>

<h2 id="fun">Fun</h2>

<p>This has now been deployed on toollabs for a month or so, and I&rsquo;ve a couple of fun tools already written using it (and other people too). We had a patched memcached server we had that we&rsquo;ll kill in a few weeks, so people who used memcached before are also migrating to redis. And I was able to do all this without even having root! This is mostly thanks to the fact that we try to keep all our configuration in puppet (<a href="https://github.com/wikimedia/operations-puppet">Wikimedia&rsquo;s Puppet repository</a>) &#8211; for both our production cluster and for everything else. So I could re-use our production redis module, make changes to it, and build the new solution &#8211; all while being vetted by &lsquo;proper&rsquo; ops people (whom I dearly love and respect). Building infrastructure in such a collaborative manner is a lot of fun, and I think I&rsquo;m hooked. It&rsquo;s fun!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Whereas, the programme showed a man performing an act of stand_up comedy and mouthing vulgar words accompanied by obscene and suggestive gesture and gyration. During his performance, the man was shown uttering dialogues denigrating women, indecently and crudely referred to sex organs of men-and women and the sing-song rendition by the man sought to pornographically describe .the male lust, depicting women as a commodify of sex. The portrayal appeared to deprave, corrupt and injure the public morality or morals</p>

<p>By that logic, I suppose 90% of all Indian Movies (and especially songs) should be banned too.</p>

<p>Screenshot of Autosuggest working in Tamil on <a href="http://github.com/wikimedia/aosp-morelangs-ime">my variant</a> of the Android keyboard. I&#8217;ve been working on this on and off for the last few months (this is also my final year project in college). I&#8217;ve ported all of the <a href="https://github.com/wikimedia/jquery.ime">jQuery.IME</a> languages to work on the keyboard natively.</p>

<p>Now experimenting with Autosuggest. It only needs an appropriate dictionary now and we&#8217;ll be good to go. Currently I&#8217;m getting Autosuggest working only on Tamil, but the plan is to get it to work for all Indian languages. The method I am using (convert everything back to latin chars, then do autocorrect / autosuggest) means it should be trivial to extend to any transliteration based input method.</p>

<p>I have spent far too much time in the company of people who set in motion the process that results in stuff like this (and their blinking &#8216;NEW!&#8217; gifs), and I&#8217;m not going to be anywhere near where they are.</p>

<p>Now to find a Bank that hires less incompetent people&#8230;</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: For good measure, they&#8217;ve now locked me out of the account, so a good part of my cash is now locked in there. Should go the physical location asap and transfer all of it out.</p>

        Calculating the population of India on Wikipedia
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">Sun, Mar 31, 2013</span>

    <p>Exploring the English Wikipedia randomly, I encountered <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template:Indian_population_clock">this template</a> used to approximate the current live population of India. It uses the following simple formula:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>(1176242 + 42.197260273969 * days_since(2010,1,26)) * 000</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#8217;s based on population at a specific data + projected growth. The &#8216;update&#8217; is done by (best guess) some bot hitting <a href="https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Manual:Purge">action=purge</a> every night to re-do the calculation.</p>

<p>And where is this used? After looking at the template&#8217;s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template:Indian_population_clock?action=info">info page</a>, the only article this seems to be used in is the India article, and that too only for population density statistics, rather than actual population statistics. Weird, since if Density can be calculated based on projection, I guess population could be too.</p>

<p>The machinations that people invent on Wikipedia are very fascinating! I hope to discover more over time. If you&#8217;ve suggestions on places for me to look (please, no <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template:WPBannerMeta">WPBannerMeta</a> / associated templates!), leave comments!</p>

<p>While this would make sense in someplace like the military, where you go in and then train, it makes no sense for graduates of an engineering program, where they spent 4 years of their life training. They claim that t<span style="line-height: 13px;">hey spent four years studying programming but can not pass a simple written programming test, and do not want to even attempt writing it.</span></p>

    <p>Tor is one of those things that you don&#8217;t really need at all until you really really need it. I don&#8217;t need it right now, but I still try to help it as much as possible. One of the easiest way to do so is to run a <a href="https://crypto.stanford.edu/flashproxy">flashproxy</a> (has nothing to do with Adobe!) on your browser &#8211; super simple to setup, and effective for people looking for <a href="https://www.torproject.org/docs/bridges">bridges</a>.</p>

<p>The easiest way to use it if you&#8217;re a Chrome user is to use the <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/cupcake/dajjbehmbnbppjkcnpdkaniapgdppdnc">CupCake</a> extension (the initial colorscheme is a bit&#8230; geocities-y, but I&#8217;ve sent in <a href="https://github.com/glamrock/cupcake/pull/1">a patch</a> to fix that). You can also add <a href="https://gitweb.torproject.org/flashproxy.git/blob/HEAD:/modules/mediawiki/custom.js">this snippet</a> to your Mediawiki wiki either as a userscript or gadget. If you&#8217;re running a site, you can simply use <a href="https://crypto.stanford.edu/flashproxy/#badge-howto">the snippet on the flashproxy site</a> to have it run for all your visitors.</p>

    <p>I am too young to remember Microsoft doing anything that could be considered <em>effective</em> &#8216;Embrace, Extend &amp; Extinguish&#8217; (my first browser when using internet at home was Firefox 0.9), and hence could never appreciate the general suspicion with which everything Microsoft was viewed with. Google&#8217;s handling of Reader has remedied that for me, however.

        Android RegEx bug: ‘null’ replacement with Matcher.replaceAll
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">Fri, Mar 22, 2013</span>

    <p>Android&#8217;s <a href="https://developer.android.com/reference/java/util/regex/Pattern.html">Regular Expressions</a> engine is API compatible with the generic Java implementation, but under the hood uses <a href="http://userguide.icu-project.org/strings/regexp">ICU&#8217;s RegEx engine</a>. This usually causes no problems, until it does and then you&#8217;re sortof fucked, but not really.</p>

<p>On a recent project, a subtle bug in Android&#8217;s <code>Matcher.replaceAll</code> behavior bit me. When replacing values of captured groups (<code>'$1'&lt;/code,&lt;code&gt;'$2'</code>, etc), Android&#8217;s implementation replaced a reference to an empty group with the literal string <code>'null'</code> instead of just skipping it (aka replacing with empty string <code>''</code>), which is what most other Java implemetations do. The string <code>'null'</code> is, I think, <em>never</em> the right behavior. And the inconsistency causes unit tests to pass when run on the desktop JRE to fail when run in Android, which is a major pain.</p>

<p>Fortunately Android is Open Source, and I was able to track down the <a href="http://grepcode.com/file/repository.grepcode.com/java/root/jdk/openjdk/6-b14/java/util/regex/Matcher.java#Matcher.replaceAll%28java.lang.String%29">offending piece of code</a>, and just write myself <a href="https://gist.github.com/yuvipanda/5225151">a simple replacement</a> that has the bug fixed:</p>

    <span class="post-date">Fri, Mar 22, 2013</span>

    <p>I&#8217;ve been mostly off Twitter for a while now, interacting with it rarely, and only on my Phone. While I&#8217;ve had a vague feeling of uneasiness ever since they unveiled their now <a href="https://dev.twitter.com/terms/api-terms"><em>business friendly</em> developer policies</a>, it really hit home when my favorite Android twitter app, Falcon Pro, hit <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/2/23/4021380/falcon-for-android-hits-twitter-token-limit">Twitter&#8217;s arbitrary user token limit</a> (and Twitter declined to care). That, plus the Google Reader saga have jolted me out of complacency a bit.</p>

<p>It may be cliche, but &#8220;If you are not paying for it, you are the product&#8221; rings rather true at the moment.</p>

<p>So I&#8217;ll mostly be off Twitter (and Facebook too) now. Identi.ca seems inactive, but I will probably give it a shot too. I&#8217;m going to pick up the slack by actually blogging instead. Twitter seems to have completely killed my long form text writing ability. My Nexus 7 and bluetooth keyboard will hopefully help bring it back! Twitter is still good for publicity, so I&#8217;ll need to find a way to feed my blog links into Twitter.</p>

        Worse is Worse

    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">Sun, Jan 27, 2013</span>

    <p>Richard Gabriel&#8217;s <a href="http://www.jwz.org/doc/worse-is-better.html">Worse is Better</a> (falsly attributed to <a href="http://www.jwz.org">jwz</a> by many), is a piece on how LISP lost out to C, despite being &#8216;better&#8217;.</p>

<p>Jim Waldo&#8217;s <a href="http://www.artima.com/weblogs/viewpost.jsp?thread=24807">Worse is Worse</a> notes, quite accurately, that what us geeks consider &#8216;better&#8217; might not what is, in the context of the universe at large, &#8216;better&#8217;. To quote,</p>

<blockquote>
<p>[&#8230;] what we see is that better is a complicated notion, and can depend on a variety of different metrics. It may be disappointing to find out that what we geeks think of as better may not be what our customers think is better. But finding this out shouldn&#8217;t surprise us too much.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There is also explanations on how on many of the examples used to justify worse as being &#8216;better&#8217;, the wrong criteria was being used.</p>

<p>The original piece has been used to justify people producing shoddy, shitty work quite frequently. Waldo agrees:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>My problem with the slogan is that it has become a catch phrase for those who either haven&#8217;t read the original article, or have read it and either have forgotten what it really talked about or never understood it in the first place. As a catch phrase, it is often used to justify shoddy design, or following the crowd rather than doing what is right, or as short-hand for the real claim that our customers are too stupid to either appreciate or deserve high quality products. Why spend the time doing things right, this line of reasoning goes, when we all know that worse is better. You are far better off giving the customer something that you know is less than what you could produce, because they (those simple customers) will think that it is better.</p>

<p>The end result of this thinking is sloppy products that don&#8217;t work, are hard to use, or are unreliable (or all of the above). We try to convince our customers that this is the way software has to be, and then turn around and convince ourselves that they won&#8217;t pay for anything better. But we short-change our customers, and we cheapen our craft, when we put up with this sort of thinking. When the original article was produced, I don&#8217;t think that this is what the author had in mind; even if it was, it is time for us to reject the simple-minded interpretation of the slogan, and start putting out software that really is better (on the dimension of goodness that our customers have, not necessarily our own).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#8217;ve sadly had to personally witness this at a few places. When &#8216;shit work&#8217; becomes acceptable, it very soon becomes the norm. Eventually people consider that not just the norm, but <em>something to aspire to</em> &#8211; as if producing something that is actually shit is, somehow, <em>better</em> than producing something actually better. If you notice that happening to yourself / your project, please step back a bit, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Whacking_with_a_wet_trout">trout</a> yourself, and do the right thing.</p>

    <p>I left Chennai on the 3rd of November. I (will be) leaving Delhi on the 4th of December. That&#8217;s a 31 day trip. It taught me to be optimistic. It taught me in very real terms that the world is a large place, and so is life.</p>

<p>A few highlights:</p>

<ul>
<li>Building an app from nothing to workable state in a few days</li>
<li>An actual first class train ride in India</li>
<li>Running into a bunch of random french people who ended up becoming travel buddies</li>
<li>Feeling small, and very temporary being in the ruins of Hampi. Here was a civilization that used to be great, reduced to rubble visited by 2-3 tourists a year. Our Data centers and Washington Monuments will be similar in a few hundred / thousand years. &#8220;The one thing a man can not truly have, is perspective&#8221; &#8211; DA.</li>
<li>The best lassi money can buy</li>
<li>First train ticket that was confirmed after being waitlisted</li>
<li>RAVE!</li>
<li>The scenery at the Goa Beaches</li>
<li>Learning to float in the ocean. ZOMG THIS IS AWESOME!</li>
<li>Pulling a passed out guy out of the ocean, and seeing how other locals react to that.</li>
<li>Watching Rob Moen try to negotiate with the local hawkers</li>
<li>Stopping at a Pharmacy every time we get into an Auto with Rob Moen</li>
<li>Being annoyed at Jon Robson&#8217;s eternal optimism,  and then eventually coming to accept that it is a good thing</li>
<li>Feeling incredibly unsafe in Aurangabad 2 days after Bal Thackaray&#8217;s death, harassed by a bunch of auto men.</li>
<li>Being told flat out that I&#8217;m not Indian, and having to pull out ID to prove otherwise</li>
<li>Being stranded in Aurangabad, with a bus journey out costing about 50 hours</li>
<li>An airport (Aurangabad) smelling of pure unadultered human shit.</li>

    <p>SumaStorm was my desktop computer. She died a slow, silent and agonizing death over the past few months, which came to light only today. Due to my neglect, she is dead today.</p>

<p>I built SumStorm with my own hands, bought with my own money (thanks to several amazing people on the web) when I was 16 or so. It felt amazing when I first booted it up. It felt amazing when I maxed out all its cores running distcc with my netbook. It felt amazing that I could run Photoshop in a Win7 VM on Ubuntu and not feel a stutter.</p>

<p>It was an amazing machine.</p>

<p>I felt horrible when I realized the extent of the damage the rats had done. This must be how kid feel when the pet dog they grew up with dies. When run over by a tank. Which the kid was driving.</p>

<p>I did not know I could be this attached to a machine. It turned out to be a very emotional few hours.</p>

<p>RIP SumaStorm. I&#8217;m sorry.</p>

    <span class="post-date">Wed, Oct 3, 2012</span>

    <p>Earlier this month I spent a couple of days as a &#8216;guest&#8217; at Infosys Mahindra City (district finals for <a href="http://campusconnect.infosys.com/Aspirations/">Aspirations 2020</a> &#8211; a TopCoder style programming competition). Interesting experience.</p>

<p>No laptops allowed. No storage devices either. Cameras are okay, but &#8220;<em>please don&#8217;t take pictures&#8221;</em>. Phones are okay too. The usual complimentary grope as you enter. Random security guards ask &#8220;<em>Where is your ID card?&#8221;</em> at random times. Buses bringing in hordes of people. Couples being couply in food courts. Reasonably good food. Formal clothes, without regard to the weather.  Everyone smiles when talking (unless they&#8217;re security guards). Respectful deference to hierarchical authority (with a big smile &amp; explicit announcements of gratefulness). Unlocked cycles to travel around the campus.</p>

<p>A vague sense of order, but no sense of purpose.</p>

<p>This is what people are trying to (and mostly succeeding) in making Engineering &#8216;education&#8217; resemble. If you&#8217;ve made peace with how engineering colleges are, you&#8217;ll feel completely at home at Infosys. Accident?</p>

    <p>When you&#8217;re proxying requests via nginx, you might assume after reading [the documentation][1] that every header is forwarded, except for the Host and Connection headers.</p>

<p>You&#8217;d also be wrong.</p>

<p>nginx <strong>drops</strong> all headers with an underscore in them.</p>

<p>This is a configurable settings. You can turn it on with a simple</p>

<pre>underscores_in_headers on</pre>

<p>I&#8217;m still baffled as to *why* this is <a href="http://wiki.nginx.org/HttpCoreModule#underscores_in_headers">a configuration parameter</a>. And why it is turned off by default. And why there is no mention of it in the proxy docs.</p>

<p>Thanks to <code>kolbyjack</code> on <code>#nginx</code> for helping me figure this out.</p>

        My First Program
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">Sat, Jan 7, 2012</span>

    <p>Note: These are almost a decade old. Reproduced as close to memory as possible</p>

<p>My first memories of programming aren&#8217;t actually C. They were GW-BASIC, and later on, LOGO. I don&#8217;t remember any of my BASIC &#8211; but I do remember the look on my computer science teacher&#8217;s face in 5th grade when I managed to draw a flower with LOGO when everyone else was doing rectangles and lines. I vividly remember it &#8211; you draw an arc for a certain length, then stop, draw another arc in the reverse direction for the same length &#8211; and you have a petal. Then you just offset your next arc by a few degrees, repeat the previous thing, and you have another petal. Do this a few times such that <code>offset-degreese * count = 360</code> and you have a flower. That I could just modify the variables <code>length</code> and <code>offset-degree</code> to draw flowers as big, and with as many petals as you want &#8211; it blew my mind. This was in 5th grade &#8211; and I immediately started pestering my parents to put me in a programming language class outside (I had already gone to classes for _cough_MS Office<em>cough</em> and DOS back then). And the SSI nearby happened to be teaching a reasonably cheap <code>Unix/C/C++</code> class.</p>

<p>The first thing I remember still is someone telling me &#8220;you don&#8217;t need to type out clearscreen(); &#8211; clrscr() would do&#8221;. This was TurboC, and to me, at that point of time, a &#8216;good program&#8217; was one that had a <code>getch()</code> call at the end and a <code>clrscr()</code> in the beginning :)</p>

<p>The <code>Unix/C/C++</code> course &#8211; I don&#8217;t remember any Unix in it. And the C++ was disinteresting to me, because I saw no point in inheriting mammal from animal or car from vehicle. So I went about writing &#8216;C++&#8217;, which was basically C but with <code>cout</code> and <code>cin</code> instead of <code>printf()</code> and <code>scanf()</code> (I wouldn&#8217;t understand classes and how/why they were useful until I read <em>Hardcore Visual Basic 5</em> and saw the ways classes are useful and how much it sucks that VB doesn&#8217;t have them).</p>

<p>I had written a program called <code>DOSTutor</code> then (end of 5th grade, I guess?). It had screens and screens of text that &#8216;taught&#8217; you DOS commands, and then ones that made you type them in and &#8216;checked&#8217; it. Initially I had written it as a long series of <code>printf()</code> and <code>scanf()</code> statements. Suddenly some bulb went on and I realized I could cut my program size by about 90% if I separated code and data, and put the data (screen text and responses) into arrays. The feeling you get when you can reduce code drastically with no reduction in functionality (+ easier to make &#8216;fixes&#8217;) is quite incredible :)</p>

<p>But nobody ever used that program, so I wouldn&#8217;t consider that my first &#8216;program&#8217;. I spent the next year or so messing around with random <code>sound()</code> and <code>nosound()</code> calls producing &#8216;music&#8217; (including a few times when my code hit the <code>sound()</code> call, but crashed before the <code>nosound()</code> call &#8211; thus making the PC Speaker whine constantly, without any apparent way to turn it off. I used to just reset the computer then &#8211; until I learnt what exactly a <code>DOS System Call</code> meant. Then I wrote another small program that just called <code>nosound()</code>). I also remember messing around with BGI Graphics, mostly taking the example programs for <code>graphics.h</code> and modifying them to make somewhat-pretty figures.</p>

<p>My first &#8216;real&#8217; program was an implementation of a variant of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forms_of_cricket#Book_Cricket">Book Cricket</a>. It even had a stored High Scores file. It was my stint at a &#8216;programming center&#8217; (SSI, for those who remember), and I kept it in a Network Drive that I accessed using &#8216;Map Network Drive&#8217;. The amount of fun that was had when I discovered <code>rand()</code> was quite something. It even beeped when you got out!</p>

<p>I lost it all in a server crash. Just do &#8216;Map Network Drive&#8217; once and it was no longer there. I think I came home and cried :(</p>

<p>What was <em>your</em> first program?</p>

<ol>
<li>Moving yuvi.in to my <a href="http://prgmr.com">prgmr</a> server. I want wordpress for my blog, but I don&#8217;t want to run MySQL. Solution? Keep blog where it is (with the awesome <a href="http://webfaction.com">webfaction</a> people!) and use <a href="http://nginx.org">nginx</a> to proxy requests to blog/. Seems to work, so yay!</li>
<li>Rewrote tawp.in to use python/flask/memcached. Available on github. Replaced older node.js version</li>
<li>Reading through _The Art of Unix Programming_ on kindle. Amazing book so far.</li>
<li>Fixed a few more bugs on Wikipedia App. I think I&#8217;ll keep &#8216;official&#8217; Wiki related stuff off this, unless it&#8217;s big?</li>

    <p>Worked the day first from Domlur bus terminus, and then from Exotel&#8217;s office (with @vijaysw).</p>

<ul>
<li>Incorporated search results (rather than just suggestions) into the Wikipedia app. Was a slight bitch to get right, but after that have made a bunch of variants that the others are testing out to see which one feels good (Suggestion if exists, else search, or search alone). Took up most of my time.</li>
<li>We put out a dud as RC3 for the Wikipedia app. A missing defaults statement. Lesson learnt: Test the entire process (uninstall -&gt; install -&gt; run -&gt; test) before passing off RCs</li>
<li>HyperJuice battery has arrived. Commence working out of random public places.</li>

<li>livetrains work. Trying to move (minimal) build system to waf. Somewhat complicated, not as fluid as I&#8217;d like. Go to rake. Feel weird about starting from scratch, come back to waf. Not get anything done Another rake diversion. Final Makefile editing desperation. I give up &#8211; I need to spend atleast a day to get back on proper build tools. That day is not today.

<ol>
<li>Added feature to change font size to wikipedia app. That took almost a couple of days and ended up being less than 20 lines of code. First was trying to enable pinch and zoom, but only for an iframe &#8211; proved impossible. And then a long time of headwalling about how I&#8217;m not able to manipulate the DOM inside the iframe (despite code in other places being able to do it just fine (no crossdomain issues here)), I had given up and moved elsewhere. Finally brion suggested I try inserting a <link> into <head>, which actually did work. So much for the browser being sane</li>
<li>&#8216;Refined&#8217; the search behavior of the wikipedia app a bit more. Also got bit by a difference between zepto (that we use) and jQuery (whose docs I have to read, since zepto by itself seems to have no docs). Had to read through the code to fix it, and managed to.</li>
<li>Closed a *lot* of bugs. BOY THAT FEELS GREAT!</li>

<li>Went to Bangalore Wikipedia Meetup. Was nice meeting people I knew online face to face. Talked about yenWikipedia, and learnt a lot about how article selection for offline wikipedia is done.</li>
<li>Shot myself in the foot multiple times (over use of empty(), incomplete commit summaries and a tab/spaces issue). I&#8217;m rusty and it is showing. Shouldn&#8217;t be a problem anymore, though &#8211; because of you-know-what.</li>
<li>Built myself a local copy of mediawiki docs. No more annoying huge-images.</li>
<li>Got myself the solarized theme. And increased font size to normal levels (13pt). My eyes thank me.</li>

<li>Read through the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:WPBannerMeta">WPBannerMeta</a> template (and its subtemplates), figured out where to get the assessment markers in. Poof that was hard. These templates are perfect examples of &#8216;hacks&#8217; &#8211; initially &#8216;designed&#8217; for templating text, they&#8217;ve grown into homebrew programming languages that are worse than PHP.

<p><a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/n1ddk/why_i_will_never_feel_threatened_by_programmers/c35juok">Beautifully laid out by someone</a> in the under-trafficked <a href="http://reddit.com/r/india">r/india</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>my state has 300+ engineering colleges and my parents decided that i am going to be an engineer. so, i wrote an exam and got into one institute (luckily i can make it into a good institute where there are campus interviews.. the luck being i might have gotten 2 multiple choice questions correct than an unfortunate guy who will be discarded by our society)</p>

<p>Here i am in college. Nothing big here, professors are very friendly and if you are good to them(i always made it a point never to refuse whatever they ask ,,, please do not think i am homo), they will give marks, or you can later request them and because your future is at stake they will give you some marks.</p>

<p>when the admin password for our oracle installation did not worked, my professor in DB class wondered if we could have tried it with some more <em>s (</em>**<strong><em><em>) instead of 6 *s(as in *</em></em></strong>*). This is one of the A+ rated institute in the country and the professor is a phD in CS. No, the password is not made of * characters.</p>

<p>In the examination we are supposed to write the code (yes, the code) on paper and submit it. Most of the guys did scored more than 80% by writing an universal program (includes, defines, main (), some function names related to the problem, the usual i j k and l, loops and finally adding fflush () and return at the end ) nobody can dare try to understand what is in between.</p>

<p>We had this big campus placement drive, when we got the usual aptitude (if ram worked for 4 days and shyam for 5 days, in how many days the work is completed) and tricky questions ( can you write a one line c code to find if a number is even) and the most complex of them (string reversal, tree traversal) questions, leaked one day before from the previous college the company went to recruit. we all prepared well and some got lucky. most of the times, even if fail to answer any of the questions, but smile pleasantly, you got in. sometimes, even the smiling part it not necessary, you just have to act how stupid they are to ask such questions to you..</p>

<p>when we joined this big company, we got trained in how to use the PC and every programming language and every operating system and every technology, each one not taking more than a couple of days. We worked hard and successfully completed the training. the test is on a PC, but the question bank is known (airtel friends ad).</p>

<p>Now, we are put into a project, we are given a contact number of the manager and office location and were told to meet him there. we, group of 3 people (we are friends by now) try to locate the manager hard for 2 days and finally get hold of him. we explain him that we are sent by Ms.knowallthingsbutactuallydumb to work in (t)his project.</p>

<p>He jovially introduces us to the technical lead. TL says he will give work after some time, but meanwhile asks us to 1) collect all the birthdays,contact number, mail id, designation details of all the team members, make an excel sheet and mail it to everyone. 2)sit with a senior engineer who is doing testing (pressing keys and entering some form data in a webpage and checking the output) and we enter the data all day and give him the screenshots at the end of day.3)attend team meetings (why we are the only ones to get there first and wait for everyone for 30 mts) make MoM and email it to every one and track the action items (yes, now we know these terms.. you cant put us in noob mode)</p>

<p>Then this goes on for 4 months, still no real IT work. we are wondering why we are not given any work (this is the 8th month we are in the company, drawing salary). we try to get some real IT work from the seniors, but they always seem not to notice us and not taking us serious. But, being new to the environment and in doubt of our capabilities, we let this go. we make merry of the free time, enjoying the cafeterias, making (cute) friends from other teams, roaming around the big campus and then one day, the manager calls us all in. this is not the typical meetings we are experienced with, because the manager talked to us into the meeting and scheduled it as high priority calendar invite, only to us, the freshers.</p>

<p>Wondering if any of us did anything wrong (it is a relief to find ourselves not doing anything at all, still) we walked into the meeting. The manager is very blunt. Higher-ups (client and Delivery manager) is questioning about the productivity and inquiring what the freshers are doing in the project. Manager tells us that we need to show output and contribute to the project work. One member replies him that we never got any work assigned. Manager becomes more serious. he questions our lack of initiative and tells us that we should deliver results. He calls the team leader into the meeting and tells him that we should be working on any pending issues and asks him to track our progress.</p>

<p>We are scared, confused, and do not know what to do. then the TL takes us to his desk and on a white paper strip (of size A8) draws a diagram (Euclid would know better shapes) explaining to us the product, process, standards, and every other thing (you should never touch the code, you should never email anyone without it being shown to me first &#8230;) and gives all of us guest permissions to a directory/machine.</p>

<p>We are all happy now, we got into real IT work somehow (may be the manager is angry, but we can impress him with our work later and change it). we also heard, if we perform better we will get sent to the USA and can stay there for 3-6 months. this really motivated us. we immediately logged into the machines, started reading the code.</p>

<p>We could understand nothing. The code is nothing like we wrote or tried to write during our college days, it is not even like whatever is taught in training. everyone of us scared now, we the freshers. now we talked among ourselves, first to know if other guy had any answers and then to know if they dont. to approach the seniors, who always seem to be busy, either at their workstation or at the printers (i do not know why such a rush at the printer area) and to disturb them with our silly questions seemed like bad to us. so we turned to GOOG.</p>

<p>everyday we gone through each source file (php, html, JS, shell) and googled the meaning of everything we do not know and that is everything. the TL never bothered us after the first meeting. we are also making notes of the things and looking back, i think we could have made a wikipedia then. such was our effort, but at the end of a couple of months it did not made any sense to us, except that we now know how to write a hello world alert page in IE (sorry, it is in HTML, JS).</p>

<p>So, we completed 1 year in the company. our reviews are coming up but we have not done anything yet. again we are in a panicky stage. Meetings are going on, but we are just continuing taking the MoM and distributing it. Now and then, we are hearing some terms (forms, tables, elements, script, position, width, validation, anchor, cursor, layout &#8230;) we learnt from exploring GOOG. it made us feel good, but we thought we are not IN yet.</p>

<p>Somehow we finished our annual reviews, all of us got mid-rating and manager explained to us later that we do not get much hike as our ratings are average. One of us who stayed late hours in office because he came late everyday(he lived in some faraway place) got 1% more hike than us.</p>

<p>This went on for 3 more months, we using GOOG to learn some terms, and doing some job works to other team mates. like one day, i stayed overtime, took printouts of the client webpages (pages and different instances) and stacked them neatly, so the senior engineer can go through them (i do not know the need for this yet), and like this another day, when i have prepared this big excel sheet and entered Pass/Fail from another automated report and this excel sheet generated some more sheets with nice charts. Another friend of mine tracked the billing hours similarly..</p>

<p>Then, one day the Manager again called us. Asked us what we are doing, and it is good to see that he is very satisfied with our work. The TL also gave a good feedback and told the manager that we worked independently and always helped the team. The manager nodded, and told the TL to send our resumes to client and put us into billing. Again, we are worried. Tension is on our faces, what to put into the resume, how to answer any questions from the client&#8230;</p>

<p>TL asked us for our resumes immediately, we prepared them and sent it to him, but prayed to god, there be no client interview. TL called us in and told us that he modified our resumes (what a relief, but wait) and added Web technologies (meanwhile clients also know our names as we are in CC list and in some group mail lists) experience and Enterprise Apps (Oh, its time for GOOG again, for us) so that it will seem relevant to the client. We wondered what will happen, if the client asked us questions on those and we do not get selected. TL told us not to worry, he will take care of it&#8230;(this time we are courageous enough to ask the TL, because we do not want to bow our heads before a white guy)</p>

<p>Then, after 5 weeks (client manager is busy or on vacation hence the delay) it is informed to us that we got selected into the team. As we are already there for the last 1.5 years and working in the project and familiar with web and enterprise technologies, the client had no objection for us to be in the project. we felt so happy, manager and TL both congratulated us, and it felt like a new job joining day for us..</p>

<p>Now, everything is set. forget the education, trainings, friends, politics in office,, Now all that is left on the highway is to cruise at whatever speed we allow ourselves. We are all so happy, and one of the friends is already planning to move to a better paying company after 1 more year of working in Web and enterprise technologies. I am already thinking about when to ask for onsite opportunity, whether i should wait for couple of months or make my wish known to the manager right now itself?&#8230;</p>

<p>So, the D Day has arrived. it is the day(remember, the speech in Independence day movie).Hence forth, i will no longer be known as just me, but as a techie (forward 1 year i can add Sr. before that).</p>

<p>My assignment and the Project?? Usability Project.. testing the clients web platform for its usability and generating metrics and reports in rich media formats.(now, you know why the rush at the printer)</p>

<p><em>Sounds</em> very true, from second hand experience of people who are working there. Anyone with first-hand experience to corroborate this?</p>

    <p>Am migrating to per-day posts now. More granularity + I can fit more info in. The ultimate aim of the DevLog is to keep me on my toes and make sure I don&#8217;t relapse into no-productivity hellholes. Daily DevLogs should do a better job at them.</p>

<ul>
<li>Spent some more time trying to get Kiwix to compile under OS X. Macports issue fixed, but more issues persist. It&#8217;s one damn complicated build system :| Not to mention that OS X sucks balls. Still no luck.</li>
<li>Moved my extension from GPoC to SelectionSifter, as picked by Sumanah (and remembered by Siebrand)</li>
<li>Added more content to my &#8216;<a href="http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/User:Yuvipanda/How_to_become_a_mediaWiki_hacker">How to become a mediawiki hacker</a>&#8216; page. Outline in shape, needs content. (<a href="http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/How_to_become_a_MediaWiki_hacker">This</a> is the page I am rewriting)</li>
<li>Cleaned up my Mediawiki.org <a href="http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/User:Yuvipanda">userpage</a>. Added stuff I&#8217;m working on there. Archived lots of older pages.</li>
<li>Published <a href="http://github.com/yuvipanda/livetrains">livetrains</a> to GitHub. As expected Kishore cleaned it up a bit. Have figured out how to do the time modelling (Thanks lifeeth!). Should finish up when I get time</li>

<p>With me back to a place where I can be completely open about what code I am writing (yay!), I think it&#8217;s time I restart <a href="http://yuvi.in/blog/tag/devlog/">my devlog</a> :)</p>

<p>Last time, I was using my old blogging engine, and hand-wrote them in a markdown file on my netbook. Things have changed a lot since then, and this time I&#8217;ll be directly writing/publishing them daily from WordPress</p>

<p>&#8211;</p>

<h4 id="dec-4">Dec 4</h4>

<p>I finally grokked Indexes in databases. It all makes perfect sense now. Yay! (And this was thanks to being able to read on the Kindle, so yay for that too). Nothing productive done though.</p>

<h4 id="dec-3">Dec 3</h4>

<p>Serious push to get livetrains project out within a few days. GeoJSON output done properly. Moved from OpenLayers to Leaflet.js on geohacker&#8217;s suggestion. Don&#8217;t regret that a bit. Also, coffeescript is fun!</p>

<p>I got to a point where I&#8217;ve got GeoJSON rendering routes. No live animation yet. Spent some time trying to find a easy screenshot saving app, found none. All the ones I found suck. Sigh.</p>

<h4 id="dec-1-8211-2">Dec 1 &#8211; 2</h4>

<p>Kindle arrived. Loading it up with books to read. SICP is good enough on it. Loading up as much as I can find about Hacker Culture/History.  Moved my entire vim setup to vundle. Not bad.</p>

        What I learnt from reading “Javascript – The Good Parts”
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">Mon, Nov 28, 2011</span>

    

<p>Just finished reading &#8216;Javascript &#8211; The Good Parts&#8217;. Here is what I learnt:</p>

<ul>
<li>I knew jack shit about JavaScript. I was able to get along so far simply because I knew jQuery and understood how closures work.</li>
<li>Holy shit that&#8217;s one fucked up language. Quite schizophrenic, saved by almost limitless extensibility/monkey-patchability/watcha-gonna-do-write-a-java-applet-hahaha .</li>
<li>If you&#8217;re going to write Javascript, you&#8217;ll have to subset. Subsetting/augmenting has its own share of problems &#8211; primarily that <code>map</code> in your code might not be the same as <code>map</code> in someone else&#8217;s code, even if they seem to be working on the same &#8216;type&#8217;</li>
<li>jQuery is incredible. I guess it is sort of like a &#8216;Standard Library&#8217; of sorts, atleast on the client side. I&#8217;m sure there exists something similar on the server side as well (underscore.js, perhaps?)</li>
<li>I haven&#8217;t written any sufficiently large Javascript program yet. Need to fix that.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="defensive-programming">Defensive Programming</h3>

<p>When you&#8217;re writing PHP, you program <em>defensively</em>. The language is out to get you. Make one wrong step and it&#8217;ll fuck you over. Never assume anything, make sure you always check the documentation. You can&#8217;t trust the language. It&#8217;s not stupid, it&#8217;s schizophrenic.</p>

<p>I think I should start treating JavaScript also that way.</p>

<ol>
<li>Because everyone else did</li>
<li>Because parents told</li>
<li>Because it will be very sophisticated and relaxing there, with lots of recreational facilities</li>

        Our Greatest Fear – ‘Flash and Fade’
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">Fri, Oct 21, 2011</span>

    <p><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5782108/1/Harry_Potter_and_the_Methods_of_Rationality" target="_blank">HP:MOR</a> is an awesome fanfic that anyone intent on improving themselves should read. It&#8217;s a bit like HHG2G &#8211; you don&#8217;t read for the storyline (which is jumbled) but for the characters, wit, rationality and humor. Quite a few of those things hit very close to home &#8211; if you are a geek, they would perhaps to you too. Highly reccomended.</p>

<p>Of the many quotable parts of that book, here&#8217;s one little nugget I found:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>_[&#8230;] the simplest explanation for this unverbalizable fear of yours is just the fear of losing your fantasy of greatness, of disappointing the people who believe in you, of turning out to be pretty much ordinary, of flashing and fading like so many other child prodigies..</p>

<p>_ &#8211; The Sorting Hat, <a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5782108/10/Harry_Potter_and_the_Methods_of_Rationality">Ch 10, HP:MOR</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>A few friends were discussing this a while ago, and I think this phrase succinctly explains our greatest fear.</p>

<p>Here is to hoping that I don&#8217;t just &#8216;flash and fade&#8217; :)</p>

        Interview with Sriram Krishnan (5 years old)
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">Fri, Aug 26, 2011</span>

    <p>5 years ago, I was in my 10th and new on the Internet. I had been coding for about 5-6 years already, but mostly with TurboC and VB6/C# (thanks to MSDN CDs I steal from <a href="http://sudarmuthu.com">Sudar</a>). And then this interview happened and pushed me farther out into geekland :)</p>

<p>Presenting a reprint from 2006, my interview with <a href="http://sriramk.com">Sriram Krishnan</a>, then Microsoftie. Note that the opinions here are of a Sriram 5 years ago, and do not necessarily represent what he thinks now :D And the questions are obviously the questions a younger, naiver (and stupider) Yuvi would&#8217;ve asked, so bear with that. I was incompetent then (I probably now am too :P) &#8211; but notwithstanding all that, I still think this makes for good reading.</p>

<p>&#8211;</p>

<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-size: small;"><strong>First, tell us about yourself</strong></span></span></p>

<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-size: small;">I was afraid of that question :)</span></span></p>

<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-size: small;">I&#8217;m Sriram Krishnan &#8211; I work as a Program Manager here at Microsoft. I work on Visual Studio for Devices &#8211; that means I help people write software that runs on smart devices, mainly mobile phones but even refrigerators, washing machines, set top boxes are smart machines. I&#8217;m from Chennai, studied in SRM Engineering College and finished my BTech IT last year (yippeee!). I&#8217;m really tall (6 feet 5), really loud and have an unhealthy love for Star Trek and most forms of TV in general. I studied in Sir M Venkat Subba Rao Matriculation Higher Secondary School. It&#8217;s in T Nagar.</span></span></p>

<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-size: small;"><strong>As a Program manager, what are your Job responsibilities at Microsoft?</strong></span></span></p>

<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-size: small;">I need to explain this a bit as a &#8216;Program Manager&#8217; is a unique beast to Microsoft. In short, PMs have all the responsibility and none of the authority. Basically, we &#8216;own&#8217; the feature. This means that we figure out how the product/feature should look like. This means talking to customers and finding out what they want. We then own the ship cycle &#8211; so we have to figure out how many features can we build given the limited time and people we have. We then go write &#8216;specs&#8217; or specification documents. The developers take these and turn this into code. We are always the external face for our feature. </span></span></p>

<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-size: small;">Now, this doesn’t mean that we control the developers in any way. All the 3 roles (developer, tester, PM) are equally important. If my developer doesn&#8217;t like my spec, he&#8217;ll tell me so. That&#8217;s why my title is interesting- I &#8216;manage&#8217; the program rather than any people. Folks get confused due to the &#8216;Manager&#8217; part of my title :) Hope that explains what a PM is in short. You really have to be here to understand the full scope of what a PM does :)</span></span></p>

<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-size: small;"><strong>Now, tell us something about Microsoft&#8230;</strong></span></span></p>

<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-size: small;">Microsoft is a weird and interesting place. Kind of like Never Never Land (if you know Peter Pan). It is big &#8211; the people here are really smart. It is scary how many people your software can touch. Imagine if you were the guy writing the Start Menu in Windows &#8211; imagine the number of people who are using your code. The sheer amount of responsibility you have is incredible</span></span></p>

<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-size: small;">Another interesting thing is &#8211; for whatever interest you have, you can be sure to find some team in Microsoft working on it</span></span></p>

<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-size: small;">Most of all, I like the people. Incredibly, scary smart. I love the fact that I can say I work in the same company as Dave Cutler (the guy who lead the development of the NT kernel).</span></span></p>

<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-size: small;"><strong>Tell us about your College Life.</strong></span></span></p>

<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-size: small;">It was awful. Seriously though, I now think that I wasted too much of my time and energy worrying about things like exams and college. When I recently went back to college for my convocation, I told my HOD that the only useful time I had spent in college was the time I had bunked and stayed at home. </span></span></p>

<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-size: small;">If you&#8217;re a geek or a creative person, I would urge you &#8211; spend time on what you&#8217;re good at and what you like doing. Spend time drawing or writing or coding. Don&#8217;t spoil your health too much by killing yourself for your exams</span></span></p>

<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-size: small;">When you reach 12th standard and all throughout college, people will always tell you &#8220;This is the most important exam of your life”. That is nonsense &#8211; no one at Microsoft has ever asked me how much marks I have got</span></span></p>

<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-size: small;">What matters is what I did in my spare time in school and college. I liked to play around on my computer &#8211; and that&#8217;s what has helped me</span></span></p>

<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-size: small;">College was awful. I spent a lot of time learning subjects I hated and that were useless to me. School was better in that there wasn&#8217;t the pressure we had in college (except for 10th and 12th public exams). The best part about school for me were the culturals I attended. I got over my fear of the public, of strangers. The public speaking I did then helps me till this date.</span></span></p>

<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-size: small;">If I could go back in time, I would tell myself before the 10th exams &#8220;Don’t worry about it &#8211; no one will ask you about this even 2 months from now&#8221;</span></span></p>

<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-size: small;">I would tell myself before the 12th exams &#8216;Don’t kill yourself&#8217;. Don’t spoil your health. It&#8217;s not worth it. No one cares&#8221;</span></span></p>

<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-size: small;">I would tell myself &#8220;Spend more time having fun. Go play more. Spend more time on your computer. Spend more time dreaming. Spend more time idling away time. Spend more time reading good books (not related to studies)</span></span></p>

<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-size: small;">Spend more time discovering yourself&#8221;</span></span></p>

<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-size: small;">And finally, spend more time not growing up</span></span></p>

<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-size: small;"><strong>Any Advice on following your footsteps and cutting classes? Tips and Tricks?:D</strong></span></span></p>

<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-size: small;">Let me be clear by what I meant there. I didn&#8217;t go to college a lot because I did a lot of creative stuff at home. In all my 4 years of college and the many, many times I bunked college, I don&#8217;t think I ever went to a movie, for example.</p></p>

<p>
  If you&#8217;re looking for me to say “skipping class is ok”, I&#8217;m not going to say it. I&#8217;ve seen too many people waste their college lives by skipping class and wasting their time.
</p>

<p>
  I&#8217;m saying &#8211; do what you want to do and what you think will hold you in good stead later. Follow your passions. Don&#8217;t go party :-)
</p>

<p>
  One of the reasons I got away with a lot of this was because I had a great academic record and I had a long history of doing well at inter college symposiums and so on. That kind of credibility helps</span></span>

    <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-size: small;"><strong>What do you think of the current &#8220;Education System&#8221; in India?<br /> </strong></span></span><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-size: small;"><br /> Loaded question and one that I pontificate on at length all too often.</p></p>

<pre><code>&lt;p&gt;
  I think it is broken. Here&amp;#8217;s why.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
  Human beings think. They are good at it too. However, no school or college encourages you to think. Human beings are good at doing new things. The greatest things in our history have come from someone asking &amp;#8216;What if&amp;#8217; or &amp;#8216;Why&amp;#8217;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
  But in school, you&amp;#8217;ll probably be branded as a brat if you ask &amp;#8216;Why&amp;#8217;.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
  All throughout school and college, I saw people being taught to be the same. I saw individualism suppressed. Being yourself was bad – being like everyone else was good.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
  College was worse than school. If you need to have 250 engineering colleges in Tamil Nadu, what chance do you have of getting quality lecturers? So you make do with what you have &amp;#8211; which is mostly lecturers who couldn&amp;#8217;t get jobs anywhere else.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
  And then they force students through 4 years of mindless torture, while the college authorities devote time to useless things like banning jeans for women and cellphones on campus.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
  I&amp;#8217;ve always dreamed of someday setting up a school where people would be encouraged to think for themselves. Where they would be taught to question everything.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
  I told someone recently &amp;#8216;The most useful time I spent in school and college was in the time away from class. In school, the most valuable thing I learnt was how to speak on stage, thanks to all the culturals I went to. In college, it was all the days I bunked and wrote code at home&amp;#8217;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
  Question Everything. That&amp;#8217;s a good mantra for everyone.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
  &amp;nbsp;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;span style=&quot;color: #000000;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If the Education System is broken, why ain&amp;#8217;t it fixed?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;span style=&quot;color: #000000;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;Because the people who can don&amp;#8217;t care. And it is the &amp;#8216;broken-ness&amp;#8217; of the system that keeps them in place.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
  &amp;nbsp;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;span style=&quot;color: #000000;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you were the Education Minister, what would you do?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;span style=&quot;color: #000000;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;I&amp;#8217;m going to sum up everything in one line.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;span style=&quot;color: #000000;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;Teach people to think. Don&amp;#8217;t teach them to be like everyone else.&lt;/p&gt; 

  &lt;p&gt;
    Have them write essays like &amp;#8216;Why is Isaac Newton wrong&amp;#8217; rather than essays that conclude with &amp;#8216;And thus, we conclude that so and so is true&amp;#8217;.
  &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;
    Teach them to question. Teach them irreverence for the status quo :-)&lt;br /&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;span style=&quot;color: #000000;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;To the young students out in Schools, what is your advice on becoming a good Developer?&lt;br /&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #000000;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Being a programmer is hard. It means days, weeks of debugging the same problem. It means having to constantly relearn your tools and your materials. Compared to doctors, the human body doesn&amp;#8217;t spout new limbs every decade or so, does it? But, you get new programming languages, new operating systems, new tools and technologies almost every day.&lt;/p&gt; 

    &lt;p&gt;
      So don&amp;#8217;t do it unless you love it. Please don&amp;#8217;t take up computers because it is fashionable or because it is an easy way to make money. Take up computers because you love it at a very deep level.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;
      Be curious. Poke around your machine. Try to understand programming at all levels. Know how to make a button spin. Know how Windows allocates the memory for that button and the data structures involved.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;
      Code for fun. Write programs that *you* will use. Write programs that your friends will use. And then write more. The more code you&amp;#8217;ll write, the better you&amp;#8217;ll get. Read good code. You&amp;#8217;ll learn a lot.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;
      Read good books. &amp;#8216;Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs&amp;#8217; and almost all of Tannenbaum&amp;#8217;s books are must reads.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;
      Code more. Learn a new programming language atleast every 6 months.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;
      Remember this &amp;#8211; no other profession can create so much with so little. You can&amp;#8217;t create an iPod or a Ferrari or even a small pencil from your bedroom. You can create an operating system though :-)
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;
      Try everything &amp;#8211; atleast once :-)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;
      &lt;span style=&quot;color: #000000;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;Eric S Raymond and Peter Norvig have written great articles on similar lines. I would strongly recommend you to find them and follow them.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;
      &lt;span style=&quot;color: #000000;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #000000;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What&amp;#8217;s your advice to students on choosing Colleges?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;
      &lt;span style=&quot;color: #000000;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;Thanks for asking me this!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;span style=&quot;color: #000000;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;Choose a college with good transport facilities. If you need to leave and come home, you should be able to quickly&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;span style=&quot;color: #000000;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;Choose one that lets students go attend symposiums, culturals without any restrictions&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;span style=&quot;color: #000000;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;Don&amp;#8217;t join one that imposes these moronic &amp;#8216;boys and girls shouldn&amp;#8217;t talk&amp;#8217; rules. Inter-gender communication is important in the workplace. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;span style=&quot;color: #000000;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;Apart from the IITs and Anna University, chances are low that you&amp;#8217;ll find good faculty in other engineering colleges. Yes, there are a lot of gems out there but they are few and far between. So you would do well to ignore claims of a great faculty&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;span style=&quot;color: #000000;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;See what the former students of the college are upto. See how many have gone on to join Microsoft or Google or pursue a Phd.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;span style=&quot;color: #000000;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;Join a college for the quality of the students, not for the education or the faculty. Trust me it is the people around you that will make the most impact on you&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;span style=&quot;color: #000000;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;Pick one that doesn&amp;#8217;t enforce attendance so strictly (i.e. they won&amp;#8217;t fail you because you have 74.95%)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;span style=&quot;color: #000000;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;Pick a course that you *know* you enjoy. Don&amp;#8217;t join a course because it is the &amp;#8216;in thing&amp;#8217; right now or because your parents said so. 

        &lt;p&gt;
          In fact, the last point merits some more explanation.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
          I see a lot of students doing this &amp;#8211; joining non-computer science departments and then getting a job in an IT company. Please don&amp;#8217;t do this. Why? For it&amp;#8217;ll be a long time before you&amp;#8217;ll get all the CS background required to be a good programmer. Computers are like art &amp;#8211; no one can &amp;#8216;train&amp;#8217; you in 6 months.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
          I need to tell a story here.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
          When I wrote my engineering entrance exams, I had to wait a few days for my counseling. I remember watching on Sun TV, an interview of the guy who had scored the highest marks and who was Rank #1.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
          He had picked some electronics related course at Anna University. When the reporter asked him &amp;#8216;why&amp;#8217;, he said &amp;#8216;Because anyone can learn computers by going to a class for a few weeks&amp;#8217;.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
          I remember shaking my head and thinking &amp;#8216;what an idiot&amp;#8217;. For you cannot learn computers by going to a class for a few weeks.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
          Pick a course you already enjoy.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; 

          &lt;p&gt;
            &lt;span style=&quot;color: #000000;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What do you think CS Students should be taught in High School? College?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #000000;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 

            &lt;p&gt;
              Python? And the Visual Studio Express Editions;-)
            &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;
              Seriously though, students should be taught how to debug. And how to code iteratively. I never understood why you have to write code on a piece of paper and then present it to your examiner &amp;#8211; that&amp;#8217;s not how you write code in real life.
            &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;
              And most importantly, students need to understand the in-depth working of whatever they&amp;#8217;re using. What is the processor doing when you do a printf? You need to understand stuff like that&lt;br /&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;
              &lt;span style=&quot;color: #000000;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What do you think of &amp;#8220;Computer Institutes&amp;#8221; like CSC, especially for non-entry level courses?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;
              &amp;nbsp;
            &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;
              &lt;span style=&quot;color: #000000;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;I shouldn&amp;#8217;t be too hard on them since I would have never got into computers if it weren&amp;#8217;t for one of these institutes. It really depends on the expectations you have.&lt;/p&gt; 

              &lt;p&gt;
                Please don&amp;#8217;t join an institute because they&amp;#8217;ll get you a certificate or because they&amp;#8217;ll get you a job. That&amp;#8217;s the worst motivation ever. Join to learn something. Don&amp;#8217;t expect them to teach you everything though.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;p&gt;
                &lt;span style=&quot;color: #000000;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What first hooked you on to computers?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;p&gt;
                &lt;span style=&quot;color: #000000;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;This is quite an interesting story. Until 12th standard or so (sometime in 1999), I had never touched or used a computer apart from a few DOS commands we used to learn by rote for our exams. I had wanted to be a writer or get into graphics and animation.&lt;/p&gt; 

                &lt;p&gt;
                  My life changed one day in 12th grade when my Computer Science teacher summoned&lt;br /&gt; me during a lunch break. It turned out that there was an unknown institute (called Comp-U-Learn) that was doing a free, promotional “Introduction to Computers” course.
                &lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;
                  Guessing that it couldn&amp;#8217;t hurt (and it was free after all), I trotted happily to this computer institute where we learnt things like how to create a folder, how to draw in Paint and so on.
                &lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;
                  One incident there changed me forever. One particular class, we were being taught how to copy-paste and the instructor happened to say &amp;#8216;Please right-click on the &amp;#8216;My Computer&amp;#8217; icon on the desktop&amp;#8217;. Puzzled, I shot up my hand and eagerly asked &amp;#8216;Sir, where is the desktop?&amp;#8217;
                &lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;
                  Everyone in the class, including the instructor, burst out laughing.
                &lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;
                  I was hurt. In an almost cinematic fashion, I vowed to myself then that no one would ever laugh at me regarding computers again.
                &lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;
                  The &amp;#8216;course&amp;#8217; was for 15 days and the institute wanted students to sign up for an additional 30 day course on C/C++.
                &lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;
                  I was the only student who signed up for the additional course. Since I was the only guy around, the bunched me with a bunch of older people who were studying Java and I got introduced to wonders like &amp;#8216;import java.awt.*” and so on.
                &lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;
                  I finished 12th standard and the day after my TNPCEE engineering entrance exams, my dad bought me a computer. It was a P3, 850 MHz machine with an astounding 256 MB of RAM.
                &lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;
                  I was hooked throughout the holidays. I spent the entire holidays writing code in VB6 and have been coding ever since&amp;#8230;
                &lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;
                  Why do I love computers so much? I&amp;#8217;m really not sure. I think it has something to do with the sense of creating something, molding something from nothingness into a work of beauty. I tell my non-programmer friends that one of the greatest pleasures of life is seeing something finally work correctly, to track down that last pesky bug.
                &lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;
                  I&amp;#8217;m also seduced by the idea of so many people using code that I&amp;#8217;ve written. How many artists get to mass deliver? :-)&lt;br /&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;
                  &lt;span style=&quot;color: #000000;&quot;&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Which Programming language do you respect the most? And, which one do you find the most useful?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;
                  &amp;nbsp;
                &lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;
                  &lt;span style=&quot;color: #000000;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;Well, one of the things that you learn over time is to appreciate different things in different languages. People ask me all the time &amp;#8216;Which programming language do I learn?&amp;#8217; and that is a fundamentally incorrect question.&lt;/p&gt; 

                  &lt;p&gt;
                    A programming language is like a tool in your toolbox. You don&amp;#8217;t use a screw driver alone and refuse to use anything else, do you?
                  &lt;/p&gt;

                  &lt;p&gt;
                    Anyway, here&amp;#8217;s a list of some programming languages that I respect and why I like them.
                  &lt;/p&gt;

                  &lt;p&gt;
                    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #000000;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Visual Basic&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #000000;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt; &amp;#8211; My first love. Made programming accessible to the masses. I love the idea that normal people could now code, even if it was only an Excel macro.&lt;/p&gt; 

                    &lt;p&gt;
                      &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #000000;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Python&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #000000;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt; &amp;#8211; My current favorite. I love its simplicity and the idea of &amp;#8216;batteries included&amp;#8217;. I think this should be the first language taught in school.&lt;/p&gt; 

                      &lt;p&gt;
                        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #000000;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;C#&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #000000;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt; &amp;#8211; My bread and butter. Anders Hejlsberg is a genius &amp;#8211; I love where he has managed to take C# without making it inaccessible to people who want their curly braces and their semi colons&lt;/p&gt; 

                        &lt;p&gt;
                          &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #000000;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lisp/Scheme&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #000000;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&amp;#8211; Twists my head in some very interesting ways. When you code something in Scheme and you see it work, you get a sense of achievement &amp;#8211; the same thing you get after you&amp;#8217;ve written an exam well. Someday I hope to understand macros. Maybe a day after that, I&amp;#8217;ll understand continuations.&lt;/p&gt; 

                          &lt;p&gt;
                            &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #000000;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;C/C++&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #000000;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt; came close to being on this list but I decided against it. Weird, considering that I write so much code in them.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
                          &lt;/p&gt;

                          &lt;p&gt;
                            &lt;span style=&quot;color: #000000;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Anyone you can call as Role Model in your life?&lt;br /&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #000000;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Interesting question &amp;#8211; I&amp;#8217;ve always had too much of an ego to acknowledge anyone as a role model.&lt;/p&gt; 

                            &lt;p&gt;
                              However, of late, I&amp;#8217;ve realized that I do look up to two people. One is Bill Gates and the other is Steve Jobs.
                            &lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;
                              With BillG, there&amp;#8217;s this whole side of him that people outside Microsoft never get to know. I am amazed at his depth and breadth of knowledge &amp;#8211; I&amp;#8217;ve read stuff from him on topics as varied as database query processing techniques all the way to virtual worlds and search engines. I&amp;#8217;m amazed at his sheer smartness and intelligence &amp;#8211; there are a lot of stories in Microsoft of &amp;#8216;BillG reviews&amp;#8217; which talk of how smart he is.
                            &lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;
                              I also love the fact that he&amp;#8217;s so passionate about software, and of late, solving the world&amp;#8217;s problems.
                            &lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;
                              With Steve Jobs, I love his eye for beauty and perfection. And I would someday like to get his &amp;#8216;Reality Distortion Field&amp;#8217;.
                            &lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;
                              Kind of politically incorrect for a Microsoft employee to admire Steve Jobs, isn&amp;#8217;t it? :-)
                            &lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;
                              &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #000000;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Quickies&lt;br /&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #000000;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;Your Favorite Books&lt;br /&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #000000;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;               Lord of the Rings, Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy, anything by Frederick Forsyth and Michael Crichton. And Peter Norvig&amp;#8217;s AI book All of Ayn Rand&amp;#8217;s work deeply influenced (and comforted) me as well.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
                            &lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;
                              &lt;span style=&quot;color: #000000;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #000000;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;Your Favorite Authors&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
                            &lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;
                              &lt;span style=&quot;color: #000000;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;Apart from Forsyth and Crichton, I loved Conan Doyle as well. I love Joel Spolsky and Paul Graham. Robert Scoble is a friend and so is Don Box &amp;#8211; I love to read them as well. Of late, I&amp;#8217;ve loved reading Guy Kawasaki. Closer home, India Uncut (Amit Verma) is always fascinating. Am I allowed to list myself? :-)&lt;br /&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
                            &lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;/p&gt;

    <span class="post-date">Tue, Aug 23, 2011</span>

    <p>I <a href="http://yuvi.in/blog/moving-to-vim-from-emacs.html">moved</a> from emacs to vim a while ago, and have been steadily accumulating a series of plugins in my <code>.vim</code>. They&#8217;re all up in my rather messy <a href="http://github.com/yuvipanda/dotfiles">dotfiles repo</a>. Here&#8217;s a slightly more neatly organized list of the plugins I currently use:</p>

<ol>
<li><a href="http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=3025">command-t</a> &#8211; File opener and buffer switcher. In-fuckin-credibly useful.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1953">vimpress</a> &#8211; What I use to blog since <a href="http://yuvi.in/blog/moving-back-to-wordpress/">moving to wordpress</a>.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=39">matchit</a> &#8211; Lets <code>%</code> work with html tags</li>
<li><s><a href="http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=3695">commentary</a> &#8211; Generic commenting and uncommenting script</s> <a href="http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1218">NERDCommenter</a> has replaced commentary due to being more flexible and having more options.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2975">fugitive</a> &#8211; Incredibly awesome git wrapper for vim. I rarely go to the commandline for git these days</li>
<li><a href="http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=3465">tagbar</a> &#8211; Useful code-exploratory plugin when I&#8217;m looking around a codebase trying to familiarize myself.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1643">supertab</a> &#8211; Buffer completion in insert mode only when I need it.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2423">gist</a> &#8211; Put stuff up in gist to pass it around</li>
<li><a href="http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=559">BufClose</a> &#8211; So I can close a buffer without messing up my splits</li>
<li><a href="http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=3509">extradite</a> &#8211; <code>:Glog</code> replacement that builds on top of fugitive. I don&#8217;t understand why this isn&#8217;t bundled with fugitive</li>
<li><a href="http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2204">TwitVim</a> &#8211; Yes, so I don&#8217;t have to go to the browser (and be consumed by chat/reddit/hn) just to post a tweet.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2572">ack.vim</a> &#8211; Ack integration for vim. Do yourself a favor and use <a href="http://betterthangrep.com">ack</a> instead of grep.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2736">Syntastic</a> &#8211; Automatic syntax checking so that I don&#8217;t miss a semicolon and not know about it</li>
<li><a href="http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1355">php-doc</a> &#8211; Insert boilerplate PHP doc compatible strings in my PHP files whenever I want to. Very PHP specific, need to find something that works across languages. (Note: This plugin has quite some identity crisis. It&#8217;s named PDV but it&#8217;s filename is php-doc. Since php-doc is more descriptive, I&#8217;m using that)</li>
<li><a href="http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2754">delimitMate</a> &#8211; Automatically closes quotes, parens, braces, etc for you. I initially thought this would be super annoying, but in fact it is rather very pleasant.</li>
</ol>

<p><s>I&#8217;m also on the default <code>desert</code> color theme &#8211; haven&#8217;t found anything better. Suggestions welcome &#8211; both for the color scheme and for new/replacement plugins.</s> After trying out <a href="http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1778">wombat</a> and <a href="http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2555">jellybeans</a> color schemes, I have settled on wombat for now.</p>

<p>Suggestions for more plugins still welcome :)</p>

<p><s>This is the list as of 24 Aug 2011.</s> <s>Updated as of September 2 2011 (added 10, 11, 12 since last update).</s> <s>Updated as of September 5 2011 (changed 4, added colorscheme change).</s> Updated as of September 12 2011 (added 13, 14, 15). I am moving quite fast, am I not? Will keep this post updated as and when things change.</p>

    <p><a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/lc-eDwUpi--JoOsYuazE7A?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-XYJudYtQiNc/TlIGAvOnTrI/AAAAAAAABHI/CCqigvtFDSk/s640/IMG_4879.JPG" height="640" width="427" /></a></p>

<p>We bought a fridge two days ago, and spent a day stocking it up. Perhaps it needs a bit more non-liquid content in it, but I think the choco fills and Dark Fantasy biscuits (not to mention the litres of Ice Cream we&#8217;ve stocked up on) would do just fine for now :)</p>

<p>And before you start harping on about &#8216;health&#8217; &#8211; the bottom tray has a mysterious cover full of apples shipped from Chennai by mom.</p>

        Non-ASCII Characters in HTTP Headers
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">Sat, Aug 13, 2011</span>

    <p>I was debugging an issue <a href="http://interviewstreet.com">at work</a> today where a (generated) file refused to download in Chrome, but the same URL worked just fine with wget. I remember reading in the <a href="http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec2.html#sec2.2">HTTP Spec</a> that HTTP headers can only be lower ASCII, so when wget mangled the output file&#8217;s name, the problem was obvious &#8211; the file name contained a character that wasn&#8217;t in lower ASCII (an accented A). Chrome had borked on encountering it, while wget soldiered on. Using <code>iconv</code> to strip non-ASCII characters in the file name on the server side fixed the issue.</p>

<p>Moral of the story? Read the RFCs! The <a href="http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616.html">HTTP one</a>, in particular, is remarkably readable and you <em>should</em> read it if you&#8217;re doing non-trivial Web Development.</p>

<p>P.S: If I had had time, I&#8217;d have went around testing this behavior in several user agents and documenting their behavior (and possibly submitting bug reports) &#8211; but <insert-excuse-here>.</p>

    <p>From <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2870176">HN</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>From my experience, the largest hurdle first time programmers have is being able to execute programs in their head. <strong><em>It takes a cognitive leap to go from the source code in front of them, and what happens at runtime</em>.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>(emphasis mine)</em></p>

<p>I believe that if you have made that <em>cognitive leap</em>, you can call yourself a programmer. It means you&#8217;ve entered into the <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2006/07/separating-programming-sheep-from-non-programming-goats.html">second hump</a> &#8211; you are a programmer. One of us. Welcome :)</p>

<p>This is also the reason why solving programming challenges at places like <a href="http://interviewstreet.com/recruit/challenges">InterviewStreet Challenges</a>, <a href="http://codechef.com">CodeChef</a>, <a href="http://topcoder.com">TopCoder</a>, <a href="http://spoj.pl">SPOJ</a>, etc also increase your general programming skills &#8211; they require that you continuously run code in the interpreter in your head. Helps you train your <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procedural_memory">procedural memory</a>. Same reason why learning different language paradigms (OOP, Purely Functional, Procedural, etc) makes you a better programmer.</p>

<p>Reminds me that I have four more chapters in SICP to finish and Clojure to learn :)</p>

    <span class="post-date">Sun, Jun 26, 2011</span>

    <p>From the usually boring Yahoo answers, we have this <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AsrKG62JfeU5scqqMv6mO0ojzKIX;_ylv=3?qid=20090208040536AAHBrYH">gem of a question</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What is the best way to stop your child becoming an athiest?</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t want any of my children to be punished by God.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>However, it also had this gem of an answer:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Do not educate them, or expose them to critical thinking, logic or science.</p>

<p>Lie to them constantly about how the world works. Feed them a steady diet of mumbo jumbo dressed up like real knowledge &#8211; the jumbo jet in the whirlwind for example &#8211; and pretend that it is deep wisdom.</p>

<p>Make them loathe their own natural bodies and functions. Convince them they are small and weak and worthless and need redemption. Tell them everything enjoyable is grievously wrong to even think about, and that their only fun should be in grovelling to an invisible friend.</p>

<p>Ensure that they resent anyone who is not like them in every way &#8211; skin color, nationality, political opinion but especially creed. Make such people out to be evil and vile and give them &#8211; impotent minorities all &#8211; the fictional power to somehow oppress and persecute the vast majority who do think like you.</p>

<p>Teach them to laugh at and dismiss out of hand any faith but their own. Early &#8211; early mind you &#8211; make sure they are taught the difference between superstitious deadly error &#8211; that one raving lunatic in the desert told the truth about a vicious god who killed people, and divine eternal truth &#8211; that another raving lunatic in the desert told the truth about a vicious god who killed people.</p>

<p>Instruct them with all severity and import to never question for themselves &#8211; to never think for themselves &#8211; to never live for themselves &#8211; but to seek answers only in one &#8211; just one &#8211; particular set of semi-literate bronze age folk tales.</p>

<p>Above all &#8211; and this cannot be overemphasized &#8211; make sure they cannot spell, use correct grammar, or understand basic English words.</p>

<p>That should do the trick.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It is, however, two years old. Maybe if Yahoo had not been the place where products go to die&#8230;</p>

    <p>4Chan isn&#8217;t exactly what you&#8217;d associate with &#8216;shit, that&#8217;s a cool piece of code!&#8217;, but look <a href="http://dis.4chan.org/read/prog/1295544154">what I found</a>!</p>

<p>(<a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2657277">via HN</a>)</p>

<p>Nice hack. And it <strong>is</strong> <code>O(N)</code> in bitsize of largest number (Ignoring all the overhead of forking new processes, the problem with the race conditions(Sort 0 and 0.1? How about 0.01 and 0.011?), processor contention, etc,.) They basically delegated the sorting to the process scheduler, treating it as a sort of priority queue.</p>

<h3 id="may-25-june-13">May 25-June 13</h3>

<p>Loads of things happened.</p>

<p>Finished/polished up ShortUrl. Pending review. Would go into not just tawiki, but possibly all wmf wikis. YAY!</p>

<p>Moved to a dual monitor setup. Dual 23&#8243; Monitors, one Samsung LED and one Acer LCD. Also moved to 8G of RAM. VMs are much less painful now.</p>

<p>Did a few back/forths with the GSoC extension architecture. It&#8217;s still blocking, so working with the non-blocking parts of GSoC now.</p>

<p>Moved to bangalore, atleast temperoarily for now.</p>

<p>Did a tiny bit of work for a friend organizing MP3s with a script. Was fun, operating at that scale. Helped me get back in touch with bash/awk etc.</p>

<p>Rooted/Flashed my Galaxy 3 with a custom ROM. SO MUCH FRIGGIN BETTER, WHY DID I NOT DO THIS BEFORE? The audio is now atleast a few orders of magnitude better.</p>

<p>Moved blog to wordpress. Archived the HiSlain project.</p>

<p>Got my camera. Need to postprocess more. But still :D</p>

<h3 id="may-25">May 25</h3>

<p>Put in a lot of effort into ShortUrl. Want to finish it up and push it to prod before &#8216;leaving&#8217;. Also learnt a bit more vimfoo. Moved it to svn and got it ready in translatewiki</p>

<h3 id="may-17-24">May 17-24</h3>

<p>Nothing positive done. Whatsoever. At all. Exams done, yeah. That&#8217;s about it.</p>

<h3 id="may-16">May 16</h3>

<p>Some TwitterBots work. Increased vim-fu a bit more. Got started on interviewStreet.</p>

<p>Also some work done on new version of ShortURL extension.</p>

<h3 id="may-13-15">May 13-15</h3>

<p>Talked out with mentor about components in my GSoC. Got toolserver account. More work on MarathonSin &#8211; @ssnbot now runs on it. Moved them all to a server. Increased my vim-fu a bit. Released 2 new versions of yenWikipedia, using a cache to reduce network traffic.</p>

<p>Still not productive enough. The number of Commits I&#8217;m doing per day is at an all time low&#8230;</p>

<h3 id="may-12-13">May 12-13</h3>

<p>Wrote MarathonSin (Declarative Twitter Bots) to keep myself awake. Started on the detailed plans for Mediawiki GSoC.</p>

<p>NEED.TO.BE.MORE.PRODUCTIVE.AAARRGGHHH</p>

<h3 id="may-10-11">May 10-11</h3>

<p>Nothing got done for last 3 days. Tried resetting sleep cycle twice, failed.</p>

<p>Did some SICP exercises. Whiteboarded components for GSoC. Nothing much. Sigh.</p>

<h3 id="may-9">May 9</h3>

<p>Reasonably productive day.</p>

<p>Finished PoC. Talked about bringing back ShortUrl Development. Started doing design work for rest of GSoC project. Read up on MySQL a bit more.</p>

<p>The other thing is coming along nicely too.</p>

<h3 id="may-8">May 8</h3>

<p>Not very productive day again.</p>

<p>Wrote sql for PoC. Read up on the db functions. Looks like I&#8217;ll be done with the PoC by monday.</p>

<p>Went on a Star Trek mini-binge. Tapestry was incredibly timely, even more than usual. Ended with me laughing alongside Picard when he gets finally stabbed. I think I made the right decision :)</p>

<h3 id="may-7">May 7</h3>

<p>Half of PoC is done. Calling it GPoC. Went off to sleep, but couldn&#8217;t so came back and worked. Feels good.</p>

<p>Have a basic extension. Figured out that I can&#8217;t just grab a preprocessed DOM off any hook. Need to work that out, but since this is just a &#8216;Proof of Concept&#8217;, I can get away with just running preprocess again. Also investigated the Job Queue and the data table update stuff.</p>

<p>Helped out @msnarain with the #goldenrulesofchennai bit. Wrote code to retreive more tweets further back out.</p>

<h3 id="may-6">May 6</h3>

<p>Need to break free. Not productive much. Got started on PoC. Ran around trying to get myself camera. Failed.</p>

<p>Helped msnarain with some &#8216;goldenrulesofchennai&#8217; bits. Let&#8217;s see how that works out.</p>

<p>Three days of failure in one day.</p>

<p>Ah, took heart after that, sketched out plan for completing PoC. Looks like one &#8211; two days work to me now. Let&#8217;s see :)</p>

<h3 id="may-5">May 5</h3>

<p>Again, not much code. Slight work on geekweekend.in. More progress on planning for PoC. Turns out I don&#8217;t have much of a chance making it to Israel. Sigh.</p>

<p>Again, not a very productive day.</p>

<h3 id="may-4">May 4</h3>

<p>Nice productive discussions with rkirti about various issues. Thanks for doing that :)</p>

<p>Started writing design docs for my GSoC Project. Need to codename that.</p>

<p>Unproductive day code wise.</p>

<h3 id="may-3">May 3</h3>

<p>My Language Wikipedia works on DuckDuckGo standard. Had given up getting it to work, but the DDG guys pinged me on twitter about it and I <em>had</em> to respect that, no?</p>

<p>My pull req for opensearch module was accepted. Yay.</p>

<p>Made geekcalendar.in. Built a very very tiny static generator that generates it. Deployed it. Tried compass/sass, but in the end came back to plain blueprint+CSS.</p>

<p>Got Ubuntu+Unity and Win7+Photoshop+Fireworks to work under Virtualbox. Yay! Fixed hard disk too.</p>

<h3 id="may-2">May 2</h3>

<p>Started talking to awjr about beginning GSoC work. My prelim work starts tomorrow, with a Proof of Concept.</p>

<p>Started work on making My Language Wikipedia work on DuckDuckGo.com as well.</p>

<p>Also started work on transliterated search for wikipedia. Fundamental ideas are in place.</p>

<p>Made a commit + pull req for opensearch python module, to let it support setting useragent (since wikipedia will 403 you if you don&#8217;t identify yourself)</p>

<p>Met vimzard, sujeet, kashyap and others today. Was fun. vimzard has grown taller.</p>

<h3 id="may-1">May 1</h3>

<p>Made two releases of My Language Wikipedia extension (formerly yenWikipedia). Works in Google Instant, and Options page auto opens now.</p>

<p>Did some brainfuck related language work. Should complete those soon.</p>

<p>Bought a new domain (geekcalendar.in). Should build/launch it soon.</p>

    <p>Dear Future Me,</p>

<p>I know you don&#8217;t want to pre-book travel tickets. You tell yourself that you like the sense of adventure and uncertainity that it gives you. You tell yourself that you need these <em>life expriences</em>.</p>

<p>But <em><strong>I</strong></em> know the truth, ofcourse. You&#8217;re just plain ol&#8217; lazy. Too lazy to book your damn tickets. So, get off your ass and book them <strong>now</strong>. I&#8217;ll promise you that I&#8217;ll hunt you through time and kill you. Also, I have unlimited access to almost all your past selves (since they will be my future selves), so I might just as well kill them.</p>

<p>So, <strong>BOOK YOUR TICKETS, IDIOT!</strong></p>

<p>Sincerely,</p>

<p>Irritated Present Me</p>

        So, I broke a law by photographing a clock in a railway station
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">Thu, Jun 9, 2011</span>

    

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/yuvi/5814701429/" title="The Forbidden Clock by YuviPanda, on Flickr"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2022/5814701429_93e0736af0_z.jpg" alt="The Forbidden Clock" width="427" height="640" /></a></p>

<p>(<strong>Update 3:</strong> Manish (<a href="https://twitter.com/#!/jimanish">@jimanish</a>) was awesome enough to point me to the official stuff from Railway Ministry (<a href="http://yuvi.in/railway_photo_ruling.pdf">pdf here</a>). It starts off by stating the cause for the rules being <strong><em>strict</em></strong>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A case relating to lapses in allowing shooting of a feature film (which resulted inburning/damage of some passenger coaches provided to the party causing a huge loss tothe Railways)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It then notes that it&#8217;s archaic, since you can even shoot from mobile phones, etc. The first few pages give you hope, because they actually read like they were written by normal people (mass reach of still/videography equipment, pointlessness of enforcement, time wasted by enforcement, etc).</p>

<p>However, they then go on to list the list of documents you&#8217;ve to submit to whichever people (possibly in different cities), and pay fees (waived if you&#8217;re using it for non-commercial purposes! Be grateful!) and then you can take photos. Multiple levels of bureaucracy, that would perhaps set a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vogon">Vogon</a> salivating. It also goes on to tell you that in certain cases all these can be waived if you can get stuff written to the <strong>appropriate level.</strong> Sigh.</p>

<p>So, <strong>yes, this rule exists. You cannot photograph railway stations without prior permission from a lot of people</strong>)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(<strong>Update 2:</strong> Expert governmental bureaucracy navigator <a href="http://twitter.com/planemad">@Planemad</a> (<a href="http://j.mp/ArunGanesh">Arun Ganesh</a>) offered <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/yuvi/5814701429/comment72157626798323703/">first hand experience/advice</a> on flickr that I&#8217;m reproducing here:</p>

<blockquote>
<p id="yui_3_3_0_3_13076357603471081">
  Ive taken pics right in front of RPF personnel, locomotive pilots and other railway people and have never run into any issues. A law does exist, but is not enforced in normal circumstances, especially with cameras becoming a common gadget.
</p>

<p id="yui_3_3_0_3_13076357603471085">
  If you ever run into issues at the railway station, the most sensible guy with authority is the station master, and you can be pretty sure he will understand the situation and sort things out.
</p>

<p id="yui_3_3_0_3_13076357603471103">
  The RPF guys are better avoided, its a frustratingly shitty job and they dont miss an opportunity to victimize someone who has strayed into some gray area of the rulebook, especially when there&#8217;s nobody else with authority around.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sounds good. I&#8217;m sure I wouldn&#8217;t have run into issues even if the guy had taken me in, considering he was drunk. Also, somehow, I think the fact that I was shooting with a DSLR was a factor here)</p>

<p>(<strong>Update:</strong> <a href="http://enkirukkal.blogspot.com/">Sundar</a> (<a href="https://twitter.com/oligoglot">@oliglot</a>) points me to these guides (<a href="http://www.irfca.org/faq/faq-railfan.html#photo">1</a>, <a href="http://www.irfca.org/~shankie/irphotography/irphotography.htm">2</a>)about the laws in place. In short, *yes* these laws exist. Yes, they are stupid. And no, I&#8217;m not going to shoot at railway stations anymore. And I&#8217;d advice anyone against doing so too (unless they are expert at bribing people (which I&#8217;m not, and which isn&#8217;t something I condone)) &#8211; just heard another horror story where a young guy with a compact was &#8216;arrested&#8217; and beaten before being released on being bribed. Sigh)</p>

<p>The law in question is one that says you need permission from two different government departments before you can take pictures inside railway stations. The law itself is not certain &#8211; my twitter timeline could find only <a href="http://www.reelindiapictures.com/permit-process.html">this reference</a> (thanks <a href="http://twitter.com/cnu">@cnu</a>!)- and that seems very much focused towards foreign nationals. I&#8217;d be glad if anyone could tell me if such a law <strong>really</strong> exists. I don&#8217;t go about breaking laws for fun &#8211; laws exist for a reason. This one, however, just feels so much like just an employee out on a power trip than a law designed to keep someone safe &#8211; so my guilt/strong moral compass doesn&#8217;t kick in.</p>

<p>Now, the story is simple. I was on my way to Velacherry, my preferred form of transport being the MRTS. I was at Chennai Fort station (incorrectly tweeted as Park, apologies), and since I had just missed a train and had to wait 20 mins for another one, decided it would be a good time to <a href="http://yuvi.in/blog/my-new-canon-550d-from-flipkart/" title="My New Canon 550D from Flipkart">test my new 550D</a>.</p>

<p>So I start shooting randomly. It&#8217;s been a few years (3?) since I&#8217;ve shot photographs &#8216;properly&#8217; (and then my camera broke), so it took me  a while to get my lines straight and framing right, etc. I shot off quite a few photos, though <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/yuvi/sets/72157626922173744/">only three turned out flickrworthy</a>.</p>

<p>Just a few minutes before my train is scheduled to arrive, I walk along and notice this awesome old clock (pictured above), all dusty and not working. I take a picture. Immediately, an obviously drunk (and old &#8211; I&#8217;d suspect 50+) railway employee (he had a Union card prominently displayed out of his pocket) started screaming at me. His basic argument being variations of:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>&#8220;Who the fuck do you think you are, taking photos inside railway stations?&#8221;</strong></p>

<p><strong>&#8220;I&#8217;ll put you in jail and beat the shit outta you, I&#8217;m (part of|know the) railway police!&#8221;</strong></p>

<p><strong><words about me/my upbringing too harsh to print, even on this blog></strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>All were in Tamil, repeated, and spoken in a way that made it <strong>very</strong> obvious that he was <strong>drunk.</strong> Unsure of how to deal with this situation, I slowly backed away while keeping my mouth shut. This only seemed to enrage him more, and the abuses/threats increased in intensity. He was screaming for well over two minutes. I never opened my mouth.</p>

<p>The train arrived, I got on it, and went on my way. A few bystanders who witnessed the whole situation (but did nothing) told me to chill, that that was just a drunk asshole I should ignore, and that yes, you need prior permission to shoot inside railway stations. I wasn&#8217;t sure such a law existed, so I asked around on twitter and got contradicting opinions (jury&#8217;s still out on weather such a law exists).</p>

<h3 id="so-what-should-i-have-done">So, what should I have done?</h3>

<p>My options were pretty limited. I think staying shut was the best course of action &#8211; you can&#8217;t argue with a drunk guy, much less a drunk entitled government employee on a power trip. But, I&#8217;m sure more experienced streetphotographers would&#8217;ve handled the situation better. How do you think I should&#8217;ve handled it?</p>

<h3 id="photographer-rights">Photographer Rights</h3>

<p>This isn&#8217;t the first run in I&#8217;ve had with Government Employees regarding photography (the last time was when I photographed some traffic police resting in the shade on a hot summer day, they questioned me and made me delete the photographs. That was four years ago though), and I&#8217;m sure it won&#8217;t be the last&#8230;</p>

<p><a href="http://thomashawk.com">Thomas Hawk</a> has a lot of posts about how <a href="http://thomashawk.com/category/photography-is-not-a-crime">Photography isn&#8217;t a Crime</a>. They are, however, US specific, and hence I don&#8217;t think I can rely on them in India. Also, even if Laws do exist, <strong>they are not enough to save me &#8211;</strong> nothing will protect me from a policeman who smashes my camera and then arrests me on a false charge because he thinks you were going to use his photograph in some demeaning newspaper article (you know this isn&#8217;t far fetched). I love doing street photography, and am wondering how exactly I can keep myself safe. Photowalking in large groups is one, any others?</p>

<p>P.S. Props again to <a href="http://vijaysharma.name">Vijay</a> and <a href="http://about.me/ratzzz">iRatzzz</a> for calming me down right after the incident. Also thanks to <a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5782108/1/Harry_Potter_and_the_Methods_of_Rationality">HP:MOR</a> (read <a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5782108/19/Harry_Potter_and_the_Methods_of_Rationality">this chapter</a> and you&#8217;ll understand).</p>

    <p><strong>Update:</strong> As usual, <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2636486">good comments at HN</a>.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve been trying to put it in words for a while, and failing utterly every time. <a href="http://swombat.com/">swombat</a> gets to the crux of it wonderfully:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>At the same time, something really bothered me about my work. <strong>It felt pointless.</strong> One project I did (whose output was basically a PPT and Word document outlining the successes and failures of a client project), which took two and a half months, had, as its only apparent purpose, the promotion of the person who had led the project. Accenture was paid (quite well) so that I would sit there and produce a piece of paper that justified this person&#8217;s promotion.</p>

<p>To me, that didn&#8217;t seem like a good use of the precious few years we have on this Earth. In fact, the feeling that I was wasting my time was really killing me inside (I&#8217;m not exaggerating).</p>

<p><em><a href="http://swombat.com/2011/6/7/accenture-before-startups">My life in Accenture before Startups</a></em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Indeed. I&#8217;d be surprised if anything in the Indian &#8220;Big Companies&#8221; are any different &#8211; perhaps worse (thoughts/experiences?).</p>

<p>There is a silver lining though:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>One of the most crucial things I learned in Accenture was <strong>how to hold back my habit of being blunt and direct with everyone</strong>. I learned to be smoother and far more effective. That&#8217;s a valuable thing to learn.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As <a href="http://vijaysharma.name">Vijay</a> would tell you, that&#8217;s something I&#8217;d definitely find useful &#8211; something that every geek would find useful (<a href="http://thingist.com/t/item/4372/">relevant link about geeks being assholes</a>, and <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2322696">excellent HN comments</a>). Perhaps <a href="http://yuvi.in/blog/infosys-tcs-or-wipro-none/" title="“Infosys, TCS or Wipro?” “None”">a stint at Infosys</a> would help me there? :D</p>

    <span class="post-date">Wed, Jun 8, 2011</span>

    <p><a href="http://blog.susam.in/2011/05/infosys-tcs-or-wipro.html">Succinctly written post that every engineering college student should read</a>.</p>

<p>Ofcourse, someone should write a post called &#8220;CS, EC or EEE?&#8221; &#8220;Neither&#8221; for high school students, because for a lot of people the answer to the question &#8220;Should you do Engineering?&#8221; is a huge &#8220;No&#8221;.</p>

<p>The comments section is even more awesome. Choice quotes:</p>

<p><em>A sympathizer/astroturfer/cognitively dissonant person writes:</em></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Are you saying that anybody who can browse the internet and knows about the computer can do our jobs? Don&#8217;t you think we would find that a bit insulting? It might be true in many cases where the proper training can make a monkey do our jobs, but isn&#8217;t that true for many fields? Aren&#8217;t monkeys being trained to pilot airships?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And is responded with multiple &#8216;yes&#8217;es. I was quite astounded, surprised, even enraged when I heard someone working there describe his job as &#8220;I do nothing, really. I&#8217;ve to press buttons and record answers in excel sheets. Rest of the time I can hit on the girls and do my own thing. Nobody cares. It&#8217;s more fun than college!&#8221;. Sigh.</p>

<p>Also, another point mentioned by someone anonymous:</p>

<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>Brand name: Students feel that Infosys, TCS, Wipro are great brand names. It is far from the truth. Infosys, TCS, Wipro are embarrassing brand names to write in your resume with the exception if you want to join another Infosys, TCS, Wipro like company or Cognizant, Accenture like companies who are ready to hire any crap that comes out of Infosys, TCS, Wipro. Good technical companies know that these brand names are like balloons. They look big from outside but has only gas inside. Actually an engineer from a good but less popular startup has more chance than a person from Infosys to get a call of interview from a big technical company.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>

<p>&#8220;Working at Infosys for 6 years!&#8221; only sounds awesome to maamis who want to buy you for their daughters.</p>

<p>Another typical attitude that boils the blood of anyone with a tiny bit of work ethic:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>hello all, what if someone(CS/IT engineer) is not interested in engineering and he wants to do mba from a very good college. But he needs time for preparation. So he make decision to join tcs/infosys/wipro (cause he didn&#8217;t get job other than these companies), only for job experience and he can get time for preparation of CAT/XAT/snap/cet etc.. Will it be a good decision??</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And of course, the actual &#8216;client&#8217; who gets shafted:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I am quite alarmed by Sam&#8217;s response, especially his 5th point where he writes that the Indian vendors send their employees to work on client&#8217;s site not because they are proficient in technology but because you need to factor in everyone&#8217;s needs and desiers. Excuse me! We need good technology people. Why can&#8217;t you guys just be professional and keep your personal lives and poverty away while discussing technology?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I highly recommend you guys go and read the entire blog post *and* the comments. Especially if you&#8217;re still in college. The placement cells at many colleges make it appear as if these are the ultimate companies ever, that you should fast and pray for 30 days to get a job there &#8211; but they have no other go. This, and their reviews at Glassdoor (<a href="http://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Infosys-Reviews-E7927.htm">Infosys</a>, <a href="http://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Employee-Review-Tata-Consultancy-Services-RVW394860.htm">TCS</a>, <a href="http://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Wipro-Reviews-E9936.htm">Wipro</a>, <a href="http://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/HCL-Technologies-Reviews-E9946.htm">HCL</a>)</p>

<p>I&#8217;m waiting for this boom to crash. And burn. Mass de-brainwashing is important for our future. This topic definitely needs a bigger rant from me someday.</p>

<p>Stolen Disclaimer:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>ALERT: If you are not interested in making a career in engineering, lack the confidence to do so, or you are very content with working for one of these three companies for reasons that are valid to you, you may stop reading this and go back to what you were doing before landing on this page.</p>

</p>

<p>I was finally able to order my <a href="http://www.flipkart.com/cameras/canon/itmczftxkzsprmvk?pid=camcvydjt4rff96g&amp;&amp;affid=yuvipandag">Canon 550D</a> from Flipkart. Their customer service was <strong>awesome</strong> &#8211; both on <a href="http://twitter.com/flipkart">twitter</a> (when the camera was out of stock) and via the phone after it was ordered. I ordered Cash on Delivery, and despite some minor issues with the delivery person (uhm, so I&#8217;m supposed to hand over 39k, <strong>and then</strong> open the box? What if I found a box of bricks?) &#8211; I got the camera within 3 working days of ordering it. Impressive. Flipkart is awesome :)</p>

<p>I also got the <a href="http://www.flipkart.com/cameras/lenses/itmczyhazkk9uzvg?pid=acccx3sgep6yd7sw&amp;_l=zmivCgZMFx0bMwIECa6Cow--&amp;_r=r9BKq32uPQ7B1KhXaW5zZg--&amp;ref=ffeaeef8-5805-4e94-a60d-2e6ee69c9f36&amp;affid=yuvipandag">50mm 1.8</a> (underhanded practice by flipkart &#8211; they say free and then bump up the cost to match. Didn&#8217;t matter in this case since I was ordering it anyway, but definitely <em>not cool)<strong>.</strong></em> Incredible lens. I haven&#8217;t even tried on the Kit Lens yet &#8211; playing with the 50mm has been so much fun. Will review both camera and lens once I&#8217;ve played with it enough.</p>

<p>Might renew <a href="http://flickr.com">my flickr</a> membership soon &#8211; tried <a href="http://500px.com">500px</a> but wasn&#8217;t good enough. Any other suggestions?</p>

<p>Very late one. I&#8217;ve been using this since last September (as those of you on twitter and following me would know).</p>

<p>It was on 2.1 for a long, long time &#8211; and even after 2.2 came out (first unofficially and then officially) I didn&#8217;t upgrade for almost a month (thanks to a missing usb cable and some laziness). I then upgraded to official 2.2, then one of the &#8216;Stock&#8217; bootloaderless ROMs, and then to InDroid 3.0, then semi-bricked my phone (trying to install InDroid 4.0) and finally settled on Kyrillos.</p>

<p>In the spirit of Anna University, I&#8217;ll now list &#8220;Disadvantages and Advantages&#8221; ;)</p>

<h3 id="disadvantages">Disadvantages</h3>

<ol>
<li>It&#8217;s reasonably slow</li>
<li><strong>GPS Does Not Work.</strong> There&#8217;s a hack to enable it, but still, geez.</li>
<li>I&#8217;ll occasionally need to force close apps</li>
<li>TweetDeck isn&#8217;t snappy</li>
<li>Playing Angry Birds will give you a headache (super slow framerates!)</li>
<li>Sometimes even the SMS app will be super slow</li>
<li>Searching for contacts is a major pain</li>
<li>SMS unread marking is incredibly awful</li>
<li>SMS storage is limited</li>
<li>GTalk can only use the first account synced</li>
<li>Swpe very, very <strong>annoyingly</strong> keeps offering you tutorials every time you misspell a word</li>
<li>Occasional Touch screen freezes</li>
<li>Not quite usable in direct bright sunlight, even at full brightness</li>
<li>Battery lasts for at most a day (I&#8217;m used to them lasting a few)</li>
<li>Auto rotate is too sensitive, cannot be turned on</li>
<li>Camera is awful</li>
<li>Vibrate is nowhere near good enough</li>
<li>Loses data connectivity at times, and needs to be restarted.</li>
<li>Loses reception way too many times</li>
<li>Never going to get official updates from now (Froyo itself was delayed by a few months!)</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="advantages">Advantages</h3>

<ol>
<li>Only 10.5k. This was when I bought it (~September 2010), so obviously newer/better phones on the market now. But when I bought it, this was the best value for money</li>
<li>It&#8217; Android</li>
</ol>

<p>Considering all these, I still love my phone :D Moving from a &#8216;dumb&#8217; phone to a smartphone was an incredibly life altering experience, and you can&#8217;t beat me into going back to a &#8216;normal&#8217; phone again. Email/Twitter on the go is just awesome. I could&#8217;ve never afforded an iPhone &#8211; Android is the PC of our times :)</p>

    <span class="post-date">Mon, Jun 6, 2011</span>

    <p>A while back, I <a href="http://yuvi.in/blog/hello-world-again/">moved my blog</a> (from a wordpress install whose data I lost) to my own platform (<a href="http://github.com/yuvipanda/HiSlain">HiSlain</a>).</p>

<p>After several close calls, I&#8217;m officially moving from HiSlain back to WordPress. I just don&#8217;t have enough time to maintain all the things I wanted in a blog platform in HiSlain, hence the move back. However, it satisfied it&#8217;s purpose &#8211; I learnt to write code I could use, others could use, and <a href="https://github.com/tamizhgeek/HiSlain">others could contribute to</a>. The <a href="http://yuvi.in/blog/oldindex.html">old blog</a> is still around (all permalinks would work) if you&#8217;re interested.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s good to be back :)</p>

<p>I miss writing posts in Vim though &#8211; expect to find/write a plugin that&#8217;ll let me blog/compose from Vim. Suggestions?</p>

    <span class="post-date">Sat, May 14, 2011</span>

    <p>It was exactly six years ago that I started blogging. <a href="http://yuvipanda.blogspot.com/2005/05/introduction.html">My first blog post</a> ow seems to be rather childish, but considering I was 14 then, maybe it is excusable :)</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve moved across several blogging platforms and urls in the meantime (<a href="http://yuvipanda.blogspot.com">Blogspot</a>, wordpress and now <a href="https://github.com/yuvipanda/hislain">my own custom engine</a>. I&#8217;ve sadly lost a good portion of my blogs thanks to a domain loss and a server crash. Sigh.</p>

<p>Also, looks like I&#8217;ve been writing code for almost eleven years now! Not counting my turboC years, that would be 8 years now. Not bad, eh? I&#8217;ve been coding for more than 60% of my life :)</p>

    <p>No, I&#8217;m <em>not</em> going to blow your mind by telling you I&#8217;m going to do the SICP exercises in BrainFuck :)</p>

<p>I just wrote <a href="https://gist.github.com/969657">my first brainfuck program</a>. Might as well be my last, but not sure. Tape-based turing-ish programing seems fun, so maybe I&#8217;ll try that again with something more expressive than brainfuck (or maybe that is pointless?)</p>

<p>And I&#8217;m doing the SICP Exercises. In <a href="http://groups.csail.mit.edu/mac/projects/scheme/">MIT-Scheme</a>. I&#8217;ve put them <a href="https://github.com/yuvipanda/sicp-exercises">up on GitHub</a>. I&#8217;m doing this with the <a href="http://fpug-c.posterous.com/">FPUG-C</a> SICP Study Group, so hope I&#8217;m able to complete it all this time :) Big props to <a href="http://www.openbala.com/">Balaji</a> for organizing it, and letting us get away with the free coke and coffee!</p>

<p><em>I&#8217;ve started keeping devlogs, recording productive activity every day in an attempt to publicly shame myself into doing productive things. This is the delayed april edition</em></p>

<h3 id="apr-30">Apr 30</h3>

<p>Impromptu talk at ChennaiPy meet. Then fun discussions at Nerd Dinner. No code, sadly.</p>

<h3 id="apr-29">Apr 29</h3>

<p>Google Instant mostly works on yenWikipedia. Made a release. More exams.</p>

<h3 id="apr-22-8211-28">Apr 22 &#8211; 28</h3>

<p>Nothing much done. Exams and stuff.</p>

<p>Tecoholic forked yenWikipedia and created a Firefox extension. Adding features faster than me. Yay! :)</p>

<h3 id="apr-21">Apr 21</h3>

<p>Started exam mode. Two units in OOAD done. Fixed proto.in.</p>

<h3 id="apr-20">Apr 20</h3>

<p>Long discussions with Kishore about data model for BRi. We&#8217;re going with the simpler one. Also, spent a lot of time discussing ideas for his new project with @notnarainan. Was fun!</p>

<p>Scraped entire Pune bus data into neatly structured JSON files and sent &#8217;em to Planemad. Let&#8217;s see how that turns out.</p>

<p>Started using SIO. Installed Variables Extension and started on Loop Extensions.</p>

<h3 id="apr-19">Apr 19</h3>

<p>Updated ShortURL to use base64 instead of 36. Helped Kishore start writing tests. Nothing productive much</p>

<h3 id="apr-18">Apr 18</h3>

<p>Removed / <em>private</em> / from LoadBalancer and Title. Patch got through. hexmode believes I&#8217;ll not have any problems getting commit access. Nice :)</p>

<p>Met gsathya, genghiz9, stattrav, superkiddo and idlecool at bessie beach today. Was fun.</p>

<h3 id="apr-17">Apr 17</h3>

<p>Not so productive day. Finally applied for commit access after more prodding. Removed one more / <em>private</em> / from Title.php. And that&#8217;s about it. Incredibly unproductive day today.</p>

<h3 id="apr-16">Apr 16</h3>

<p>Slept through most of the day. @since calculator turned into a statistics generator, and lead to discussions about removing / <em>private</em> / declarations. I poked around, found a change to $wgLanguageNames that tstarling had made that had broken a few extensions. Went in, fixed them (except one of them, which was so incredibly broken beyond repair). bawolf committed them (YAY!). Unlike the UtfNormal patch, which was second hand, this was my own code so felt good :)</p>

<p>They (Happy-melon and bawolff) also suggested that I apply for commit access, since I seem to &#8216;not break things too often&#8217; :) Let&#8217;s see if I can keep that reputation.</p>

<p>Have work lined up for tomororw &#8211; get rid of as many / <em>private</em> / bits as possible.</p>

<p>Woke up, checked/fixed visibility modifiers in 3 more files. My sleep schedule is <em>very</em> messed up.</p>

<h3 id="apr-15">Apr 15</h3>

<p>Meat of code for @since calculator ready. Not many people enthusiastic about it in ###mediawiki though. Sigh. Think I&#8217;ll sleep early today.</p>

<h3 id="apr-14">Apr 14</h3>

<p>Chrome extension close to v0.2. Options page now pretty. Learnt some more awk. Slight IRC stats mentioned on ###mediawiki (Reedy came out on top!). Have my own bug to fix now. Might have to resort to awk and grep skills (hope it won&#8217;t come down to that though).</p>

<p>Kishore came home. Fun time. Spent lots of time discussing BRiWiki and how it fits into the new architecture. He tried to build out 21H with his &#8216;Segments&#8217; idea, but (as I had predicted :P) it was rather very complicated. Let&#8217;s see how this turns out.</p>

<h3 id="apr-13">Apr 13</h3>

<p>Chrome Extension for adding links to other language wikis works! Took me a while to figure out the entire thing, but finally! Wheee! Have it &#8216;released&#8217; on Chrome Extensions site. Srikanth paid the one time 5$ fee for me (Thanks:D). Wrote an email to wikimediaindia-l, should wait till tomorrow for response.</p>

<p>Learnt quite a bit about Chrome extensions. Not bad at all. Also started learning awk. Useful tool.</p>

<h3 id="apr-12">Apr 12</h3>

<p>Working on Chrome Extension to add links to other language wikis when english wikipedia link turns up in google results. Reasonably working (with Instant turned off, that is). Need to figure out a few more things and I can get it to &#8216;run&#8217; and release.</p>

<p>Discussion about Extension:ShortUrl on wikitech-l. Apparently IDs aren&#8217;t exactly unique &#8216;identifiers&#8217; in MediaWiki. Need to find a way around.</p>

<p>Fixed a bug in the MediaWiki API documentation. Yay!</p>

<h3 id="apr-11">Apr 11</h3>

<p>After long winded attempts to fix Extension:ShortUrl&#8217;s toolbox functionality ended with me banging my head repeatedly on dead ends, I <em>finally</em> fixed it. The issue was addHTML not doing what I thought it would (add HTML to current position), misunderstanding what die() does (kill output at current location, not output in general) and not asking clear enough questions on ###mediawiki.</p>

<p>Also hit a bug when it wasn&#8217;t documented when (version) a particular method was added to a class. While I was able to workaround, might work on a script that adds &#8216;since&#8217; information to all functions.</p>

<p>Chat with PlaneMad about good things for briwiki. Kishore is doing wonderful work with the recursive RDF export. Should be fun, the days ahead!</p>

<p>Also, fixed audio issues on desktop by moving to PulseAudio.</p>

<h3 id="apr-10">Apr 10</h3>

<p>Slept most of the day. Fixed mwclient issues and made 0.6.5 available from PyPI. Tried installing GNOME 3 again (via jhbuild, released moduleset). Failed miserably again.</p>

<h3 id="apr-9">Apr 9</h3>

<p>Played Cricket with Kishore. I won (HAHAHAHA).</p>

<p>Spent the night there. Packaged mwclient 0.6.5 to fix login bug. Kishore wrote code to import current stage data into briwiki. Yay.</p>

<h3 id="apr-7-8">Apr 7-8</h3>

<p>Frantic last minute grab to get GSoC proposal done. It still has typos and style issues I didn&#8217;t have time to fix :(</p>

<p>Everyone has their GSoC proposal in. Madhu&#8217;s went in after a bit of late drama about her application status being set to &#8216;withdrawn&#8217; in mentor&#8217;s dashboard. Intervention by _ke fixed things up, and everyone lived happily ever after :)</p>

<h3 id="apr-6">Apr 6</h3>

<p>Madhu&#8217;s patch was accepted :)</p>

<p>Wrote good amount of GSoC proposal. awjr says it&#8217;s in good shape. Sumanah suggested I fix more bugs, so on the lookout. Had a skype convo with awjr about the current, twisted manual workflow that I&#8217;m going to help automate.</p>

<h3 id="apr-5">Apr 5</h3>

<p>Helped madhu write a patch. Pointed karthik in right direction for sound systems.</p>

<p>Started writing proposal. First long chat with awjr. Helped Kishore a bit with his GSoC proposal.</p>

<h3 id="apr-4">Apr 4</h3>

<p>Helped Madhu with GSoC a bit more. Started working on the wikipedia offline bits. Finally got in touch with awjr.</p>

<h3 id="apr-3">Apr 3</h3>

<p>Speech at GNOME.asia. Best I&#8217;ve given so far. Hall of around 100 poeple was full, and people were actually sitting on the damn stairs! I was damn in the zone, and it was quite well receieved. Even the jokes went over well! After the GStreamer talk, I gave a pitch about GSoC. Then there were <em>lots</em> of questions. Fun!</p>

<p>And then hung out with people from #h-i. Super fun :D Then spent a few hours at jace&#8217;s place, trying to coax mwclient to work.</p>

<p>Left bangalore and landed in chennai in a bus.</p>

<h3 id="apr-2">Apr 2</h3>

<p>Nothing at all. Developed parts of my presentation for GNOME.asia. Missed first day &#8216;coz I overslept.</p>

<h3 id="apr-1">Apr 1</h3>

<p>Went to bangalore by unreserved general compartment for GNOME.asia. Fixed up CV on the way &#8211; stealing template from lut4rp. Also talked on IRC to apergos from the train &#8211; prompting her to tell me to &#8216;set a Hitman on her&#8217;.</p>

<p>Wrote Extension:ShortUrl, my first mediawiki extension. Works, and was well received in the Indian Wikimedia community.</p>

<h3 id="mar-20-8211-31">Mar 20 &#8211; 31</h3>

<p>More contract work for more money.</p>

<p>My dump patch to meidawiki got commited, then blasted during Code Review. This is what I get for trusting other people&#8217;s code blindly, especially after 5 years. Lesson learnt. Fixed all issues, and now waiting for a review before commit.</p>

<p>More help for Madhu&#8217;s GSoC, on and off. Same for Arun and Karthik.</p>

<p>Decide to give up on dumps (no concrete work found) and pick up wikipedia offline, after post to wikitech-l by the offline guy saying he is looking for people.</p>

<p>Channels #mediawiki and #wikimedia-tech are quite fun, actually. Not bad at all.</p>

<p>Started writing php code. Not that ugh, actually.</p>

<p>Spent 3 days at In50Hrs. Prototyped the CollegeReviews thing I was always dreaming about. Concepts were fleshed out really well. Need to spend more time on this thing.</p>

<h3 id="mar-15-8211-20">Mar 15 &#8211; 20</h3>

<p>Almost got fix to Mediawiki that made dumps 5% faster. Now just need to prove it on a larger scale before it gets accepted.</p>

<p>Did contracting work for some decent money. Feels pretty good.</p>

<p>Started helping madhu with her gsoc. She&#8217;s darn smart.</p>

<h3 id="mar-14">Mar 14</h3>

<p>Did bits of resume.</p>

<h3 id="mar-1-13">Mar 1-13</h3>

<p>Some amount of Mediawiki work &#8211; getting it to run, learning how to profile it, profiling the import and export process. Identified a hotspot in the export process (UtfNormal), need to try to get a fix in.</p>

<p>Moved main system from Ubuntu 32 bit to Debian 64 bit. Yay. Tried to jhbuild gnome-shell and failed miserably. Boo.</p>

<p>Started helping other folks with their GSoC. Yay.</p>

<h3 id="27-jan">27 Jan</h3>

<p>More of nothing productive. 32HourStartup is eating into my dev time.</p>

<h3 id="26-jan">26 Jan</h3>

<p>Nothing productive. Ugh. 32hourstartup website.</p>

<h3 id="25-jan">25 Jan</h3>

<p>Nothing productive. 32hourstartup website finally properly done.</p>

<h3 id="24-jan">24 Jan</h3>

<p>PiTiVi can now record audio into proper temp files, and insert them into the sources list when done. Also have a neat, complicated looking (:() VUMeter integrated.</p>

<p>Worked on the 32hourstartup website. Deployment is a bitch.</p>

<p>Couldn&#8217;t sleep. Woke up, fixed site. Fucking slow.</p>

<h3 id="23-jan">23 Jan</h3>

<p>Not much code. Worked on 32 Hour Startup website. Read more clojure books.</p>

<h3 id="22-jan">22 Jan</h3>

<p>Attended Geekweekend. Was fun. I&#8217;m now gonna learn myself some clojure. Setup a clojure dev environment. Trying to kill my JVM Biases.</p>

<h3 id="21-jan">21 Jan</h3>

<p>Read more PiTiVi code. Refactored the audiorecord bits off. Registered and put up a landing page on 32hourstartup.com</p>

<h3 id="20-jan">20 Jan</h3>

<p>Did nothing today. Read parts of PiTiVi code. Built up my ohloh profile a bit more. That is it. Sad</p>

<h3 id="19-jan">19 Jan</h3>

<h4 id="busroutes-in-wiki">Busroutes.in wiki</h4>

<p>Nothing major got done. Unable to figure out easy way to start out on chennai (the center and zoom properties don&#8217;t seem to work &#8211; maybe parser caching?). Need to spend more time on this</p>

<h4 id="pitivi">PiTiVi</h4>

<p>Finally settled on a UI that both me and @nekohayo liked (&#8216;inspired&#8217; in no small way by iMovie :P). Should start working on the actual implementation now. Sent first email to the FSF folks with some semblance of &#8216;work done&#8217;. Feels good.</p>

<h4 id="misc-sysadmin-stuff">Misc Sysadmin Stuff</h4>

<p>Setup server for Mohan.</p>

<h3 id="18-jan">18 Jan</h3>

<h4 id="busroutes-in-wiki-1">Busroutes.in Wiki</h4>

<p>Got Semantic Forms to work with Map input. Pulled in @kidbees (Bala) who did most of the Train routes entry. Templatized &#8216;Type&#8217; for host. Need to find easier way to geocode.</p>

<h4 id="pitivi-1">PiTiVi</h4>

<p>Preliminary UI work/discussion with the PiTiVi guys. The dialog box approach didn&#8217;t quite work out, so we&#8217;re now moving to something more elegant and simplistic. It&#8217;s fun working with a responsive community (@nekohayo)</p>

<h3 id="12-17-jan">12-17 Jan</h3>

<h4 id="busroutes-in-wiki-2">Busroutes.in Wiki</h4>

<p><a href="http://wiki.busroutes.in">http://wiki.busroutes.in</a> is up and running, thanks to AWS Free and @logic&#8217;s credit card. Semantic Mediawiki and a few extensions on. Getting to work figuring out all the templates and the extensions that turn SMW into something rather close to a programming language (It has conditionals! And templates can really be thought of as retarded functions). Started adding MRTS data &#8211; aim to complete Chennai Suburban Rails too fully and expose that data.</p>

<h4 id="tamilbeat-com-script">Tamilbeat.com Script</h4>

<p>Simple python script that scraped Tamilbeat.com, located all songs for all movies and spat out a shell script that used wget to download them into properly organized folders. The script also used <code>eyeD3</code> to set artist information on the songs. The script produced was incredibly dirty (no error checking, <strong>HUGE</strong> <em>fuck you</em> to &#8216;seperation of code and data&#8217;) &#8211; but worked wonderfully. Too wonderfully infact &#8211; I quickly used up 20G of my 25G allowance per month of usage, and it shows no sign of quitting. Will re run once I cross 25G.</p>

<p>The template output method was neat (template contained in .py file as triple quoted string, jinja2 template). Should rework it to seperate code and data.</p>

<h4 id="cheese">Cheese</h4>

<p>Planning on helping out with the port to gtk3. Spent good few hours on 17th setting up a gtk3 env (no jhbuild, uses &#8211;prefix and a custom activate script). Maybe I should try and learn how to use jhbuild &#8211; but my experience (and that of others in general) seems to be one of pain. Maybe next time I need to setup something custom.</p>

<h4 id="work-that-needed-to-be-done-but-not-done">Work that needed to be done, but not done</h4>

<p>PiTiVi. I&#8217;ll give it more love next week.</p>

<p>The Backup Thingy. I <em>do</em> need to do this. But when?</p>

<p>Personal Domains. Ugh.</p>

<h4 id="misc-sysadmin-stuff-1">Misc. Sysadmin stuff</h4>

<ul>
<li>Setup SSN&#8217;s Lakshya website on my server (webfaction). I personally found <a href="http://ssnlakshya.cloud10.in">http://ssnlakshya.cloud10.in</a> hilarious ;)</li>
<li>Setup PHP for Sriram on pirayalpha. Need to setup wsgi for him. Also gave him ownership of his nginx conf file, so he can actually do edits &#8211; but I&#8217;ve to be around to restart it. Proved a good decision, as he accidentally left out a } the first time he edited anything and bought the server to a halt. He&#8217;s incredibly remarkable for a 12 year old.</li>
<li>Tried upgrading my system to Natty. Botched. Main system getting more and more fucked by the day. Fresh install of Maverick, or is it finally time to move to Debian on my main system too?</li>

        NEN First Dot 2010 – What I learnt
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">Fri, Jan 28, 2011</span>

    

<p>I was part of the team that organized <a href="http://nenfirstdot.in">NEN First Dot</a> &#8211; a student startup showcase. I was involved from day 0, so I was able to see it evolve from a high-in-the-sky concept to something that actually did happen. It was an incredible experience, to say the least.</p>

<h3 id="what-i-learnt">What I learnt</h3>

<p>I was the &#8216;tech&#8217; guy &#8211; working with a few people (Karthik, Arun, Madhu, Dinesh, etc) to take care of most things tech. The entire team that organized this was rather huge &#8211; and I was pretty much interacting with them all the time. This was the first time I felt &#8220;part of something larger than myself&#8221; &#8211; part of a large Team for real. It was an incredible learning experience, to say the least.</p>

<p>Here is a partial list, written a few weeks after the event ended. By no means complete.</p>

<ul>
<li>&#8220;A small group of dedicated individuals will always be able to bring about large amount of changes&#8221;</li>
<li>When you see your <em>boss</em> work on till 3 AM, then get up at 6 AM to get back to work &#8211; it almost fills you with a sense of pride just to work with someone like that. I&#8217;ll be damned if I let myself slack off! This is incredibly important &#8211; it&#8217;s hard to respect someone who asks you to work when he is <em>busy</em> playing poker &amp; partying all the time.</li>
<li>Your team is incredibly important. Dedication matters more than talent. Who isn&#8217;t part of your team is almost as important as who is.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=flake">Flaking</a> is what marks you as unreliable and childish &#8211; and it&#8217;s very hard to shake that kinda reputation off.</li>
<li>Assigning blame is absolutely pointless. And counterproductive.</li>
<li>Email is an <em>incredibly</em> shitty way to be the sole medium of communication when organizing anything. We should&#8217;ve tried something like Basecamp. Our mailing list degenerated into unusable levels well before the event &#8211; most stuff was done via private mails with millions of people CCed &#8211; resulting in knowledge gaps and why-was-I-not-CCed-syndrome. A lot of money is there for the guys who figure out how to replace email in this context.</li>
<li>JFDI is incredible underrated.</li>
<li><a href="http://nenonline.org">NEN</a> is doing an incredible job of what the education system is supposed to be doing &#8211; making men out of boys (and women out of girls).</li>
<li>The social landscape is rather very diverse &#8211; and major parts of it are still absolutely unexplored from my POV. While at a much better position now than I was 3 years ago, I&#8217;ll still file this <code>bug</code> as <code>#needinfo</code></li>
<li>MBAs aren&#8217;t all useless. Some of the time. There &#8211; I said it.</li>
<li>Being in a college which doesn&#8217;t impose incredibly stupid rules frees up your mind to be worried about other things that might matter at some point (or not), rather than things that absolutely do not matter at all, in any universe. For example, you don&#8217;t have to worry about being <em>caught</em> and treated as a criminal for wearing a shirt with Two Pockets.</li>
<li>Don&#8217;t judge people. Don&#8217;t jump to conclusions. The world isn&#8217;t deterministic.</li>
<li>If you trust people, and give them responsibility <em>and</em> authority, they will often surprise you with the amount of work they are willing to put in. Don&#8217;t underestimate people.</li>
<li>You can&#8217;t hold yourself responsible for other people&#8217;s actions.</li>
</ul>

<p>I could probably expand each of these points into a post on their own &#8211; and maybe I will someday :) This post, however, should make sure I don&#8217;t forget much of these next time around!</p>

    <span class="post-date">Tue, Jan 25, 2011</span>

    

<p><em>[Note: I&#8217;ve a rather large backlog of blog posts to do, will push them out as soon as I can]</em></p>

<p>Saturday (22 Jan 2011) was spent at <a href="http://www.geekweekend.in/index.html">Geekweekend</a>, organized at <a href="http://www.thoughtworks.com/other-offices">Thougtworks Chennai</a>. The event had awesomeness written all over it, even before it started &#8211; how can <em>any</em> event where you register through a (rather limited, but still) command line interface on a website be not good? :D</p>

<p>I was late as usual (damn living so far away from everywhere) &#8211; and found my way walking through the underbelly of the Kathipara junction thanks to <a href="http://maps.google.co.in">Google Maps&#8217; Walking Directions</a> :P</p>

<h2 id="clojure">Clojure</h2>

<p>Missed the first session. Turned up for the clojure session &#8211; it was good. I&#8217;ve been meaning to learn one of the OMGPARANTHESES langueages, and from the tooling/library support &#8211; clojure seems to be the way to go. Spent time during the talk setting up my machine to do clojure dev (took forever to setup &#8211; it is a netbook, afterall). Wanted to build something small before the end of the event (like a URL Shortener!) but too late for that.</p>

<p>I do plan on writing something with clojure in the short term though. Looking for ideas.</p>

<h2 id="lunch">Lunch</h2>

<p>Lunch. Met the usual group of geeks around. Fun, as usual :D Lunch was excellent. Me and <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/sup3rkiddo">Superkiddo</a> continued the tradition of stealing sweets from <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/justjkk">Kishore</a>&#8216;s plate :D</p>

<h2 id="monads">Monads</h2>

<p>Then came the session on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monad_(functional_programming)">Monads</a>. I still don&#8217;t understand them. But that&#8217;s okay &#8211; the discussion was rather intellectually stimulating. It also reminded me that my mathematical/theoretical-cs foundation is incredibly weak (by geek standards) and needs updating/pushing up. Should start on <a href="http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/">SICP</a> (<em>again</em>).</p>

<h2 id="purely-functional-languages-on-the-fringe">Purely Functional Languages on the fringe</h2>

<p>The discussions were the most fun, productive part of the day, IMO. Most people who weren&#8217;t fully interested had already left &#8211; so the self-selected crowd was rather intense. Nobody there was actually using any purely functional language in production &#8211; which was expected. My opinion is that <em>purely</em> functional languages will always be on the fringe &#8211; as they should be. But features from them will trickle in slowly into mainstream, <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/avg.html">blub</a> programming languages (even PHP <a href="http://php.net/manual/en/functions.anonymous.php">has lambdas</a> now!). Learning to think in a functional way will expand your mind, and make you a better programmer &#8211; even if you&#8217;re not programming in a purely functional language.</p>

<h2 id="my-irrational-hate-for-java">My Irrational Hate for Java</h2>

<p>I&#8217;m not sure from where &#8212; perhaps the fucked up Java GUI apps, or my early stage semicolon/case-sensitivity hate (hey, I was 14, what do you expect!) or the fact that Java the language is way too verbose &#8212; I&#8217;ve had an irrational <strong>hate</strong> of all things Java/JVM. But that&#8217;s just that &#8211; irrational. So I&#8217;m taking a concerted effort to learn myself some JVM &#8211; hence clojure. I still don&#8217;t like Java the language (C# FTW!) &#8211; but the tools and libraries around JVM seem to be pretty good. Let&#8217;s see how this experiment at de-biasing turns out!</p>

<h2 id="functional-programming-users-group">Functional Programming Users group</h2>

<p>The idea of a Functional Language Users group was floated around. Waiting for it to turn up!</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: <a href="http://fpug-c.posterous.com/#!/">Here you go</a>. Join up and keep posting. I&#8217;m not sure how the idea of posterous groups will work out though.</p>

<h2 id="thoughtworks-8216-crowd-8217">Thoughtworks &#8216;crowd&#8217;</h2>

<p>I&#8217;ve generally found that events organized at Thoughworks/by Thoughtworkers have higher average audience quality than most other events. Thanks for putting together events guys :)</p>

        Enthusiastic Teachers and Naive Implementation of Gauss Seidel Approximations
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">Sat, Dec 25, 2010</span>

    <p>This semester, one of our so called <em>electives</em> (despite the fact that we have no real choice in them) is Numerical Methods. I don&#8217;t quite like the actual way the subject is taught &#8211; mind numbing, error prone calculations with a calculator. However, the methods are pretty awesome.</p>

<p>The staff explained <a href="https://gist.github.com/753872">Gauss Seidel</a> yesterday, and it seemed a straightforward recursive solution to me. So in the break, I cooked up a small python <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gauss%E2%80%93Seidel_method">script</a> that gave me all the intermediate answers as well &#8211; so for any <em>assignments</em> I could just run them through this and copy it to paper.</p>

<p>What happened after that was more interesting. The staff made an offhand remark that she hates the subject, since it involves so much mindnumbingly repetitive calculative work, and not something fun like probability theory. I picked it up, and we had an interesting conversation that ended up with me showing her a 3-function version of the above code and explaining to her how I got this. She was incredibly interested &#8211; and asked me how to explain each line properly.</p>

<p>Was a lot of fun. Sad that this is the first time in 3 years that I&#8217;ve had someone who is actually interested in what they&#8217;re teaching, rather than treating it as just a normal 9-5 job not much different from herding sheep. What exactly can we do to change this?</p>

    <p>I&#8217;m back at home after travelling almost ten days &#8211; ACM ICPC at Coimbatore, One day at Ooty, the last <a href="http://foss.in">FOSS.in</a> at Bangalore, <a href="http://nonameconf.in">Nonameconf</a> at Bangalore, and finally chilling out losing at XBox 360 Takken at the [Zynga][z] office.</p>

<p>One thing I&#8217;ve realized sharply is that &#8220;Life will take you to interesting places and make you do interesting things, <strong>if only you let it</strong>&#8220;</p>

<p>I realized that my days were being pretty much the same all day. I&#8217;ve shook up a lot of things &#8211; quit many &#8216;safe&#8217; stuff I was doing so I could go try stupid, freaky things &#8211; I don&#8217;t know what. Should be fun and interesting.</p>

<p>What stupid, crazy, freaky and <em>incredibly</em> interesting things you have done?</p>

        Moving to Vim from Emacs
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">Tue, Dec 7, 2010</span>

    <p>I moved to Vim from Emacs a while back. I realized I was not using emacs to its fullest extent &#8211; I was using it as &#8216;just a text editor&#8217;, and alt-tabbing to <code>gnome-terminal</code> for most of my work. I was using one tool per job anyway, so why not go all the way and use a <a href="http://www.vim.org/">text editor</a> for a text editor instead of <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/">yet another operating system</a> :P</p>

<p>Also, and perhaps more importantly &#8211; on my rather small <a href="http://yuvi.in/blog/samsung-n210-review.html">Netbook</a>, pressing combos felt awkward to me (I know it shouldn&#8217;t have, but it did). Much better (atleast so far) with vim than Emacs. Since most of my coding these days seems to be done on this small and underpowered machine, and my wrists were hurting anyway, I switched.</p>

<p>Muscle memory is still set to emacs (hit <code>C-k</code> several times when it should&#8217;ve been <code>d$</code>), but I guess I&#8217;ll eventually get back to being fast enough in vim :)</p>

<p>Last time I was on vim, I was just getting used to Linux, and switched to emacs a few months after. I wonder if I&#8217;ll switch again in the future.</p>

<p>TL;DR: Moved from Emacs to Vim &#8216;coz I felt like it.</p>

    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">Sun, Nov 7, 2010</span>

    <p>&#8220;Why does Cheese have a maximum photo count of 100 in burst mode?&#8221; questions have popped up quite a few times on the cheese list. It is just a teeny, tiny bug &#8211; fixed in master.</p>

<p>The work around is simple:</p>

<p><strong>Till Cheese 2.32</strong></p>

<p>Raise it to whatever value you want in <code>line 8</code> of <code>/usr/share/cheese/cheese-prefs.ui</code>.</p>

<p><em>(If you don&#8217;t know what version you are running, check <code>Help -&gt; About</code>)</em></p>

<p>(Fix is just raising the limit from 100 to something that most people will likely not hit. If they do hit it &#8211; well, <code>line 40 on /usr/share/cheese/cheese-prefs.ui</code> :D)</p>

    <span class="post-date">Mon, Nov 1, 2010</span>

    <p>I posted a while back that I <a href="http://yuvi.in/blog/running-archlinux.html">moved</a> to Arch (from Ubuntu) on my Netbook. That was almost two months back. My Arch experiment, sadly, didn&#8217;t work out for long. I moved back to Ubuntu within a couple of week&#8217;s time. Why?</p>

<ol>
<li>Lack of binary packages. I had to build quite a few packages from source because there were no binary packages available. The tilting point was when I figured there were no binary packges for mit-scheme! Ofcourse, I could&#8217;ve just used AUR and built them from source, but&#8230;</li>
<li>Building from source on my Netbook sucks. ATOM + Slow Hard Drive -&gt; I&#8217;m nuts waiting for stuff to compile. The AUR is basically useless to me.</li>
</ol>

<p>Hello Ubuntu! (I also hate Unity &#8216;coz it takes up precious screen space &#8211; might move to something else soon)</p>

<p>TL;DR: Arch doesn&#8217;t have enough binary packages and building on a netbook sucks</p>

    <p>I, along with about a 100 other classmates of mine, went on an <em>Industrial Visit</em> to Kerala a few weeks back. It was a 3 day, 4 night affair &#8211; and was incredibly fun and refreshing. New friendships were forged, old ones rekindled, temptations resisted, a thousand pictures clicked (thanks to @RohitP&#8217;s camera), group dynamics studied and incredible fun had. It was very refreshing (for the most part), and I realized just why vacations are important.</p>

<p>I plan on visiting [Athrapalli Falls][afalls] again as soon as I possibly can. Being in fast moving, (relatively) cold water is an incredibly experience I&#8217;m glad I didn&#8217;t miss. You shouldn&#8217;t either.</p>

    <span class="post-date">Tue, Sep 7, 2010</span>

    <p>One of the major advantages of my netbook is that I can actually use it in class, under the desk &#8211; and most staff won&#8217;t notice ;) And even if they do, I can easily and neatly close the lid, put it in standby and become innocent good boy :D</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve zoned out from what&#8217;s happening in class a long time back. I just looked up, and it&#8217;s something I really do like (withheld to protect the name of subject). It&#8217;s being taught in a &#8216;marks-oriented&#8217; way &#8211; &#8220;You need to write this for this much marks, and that for that much mark. Don&#8217;t you dare to miss this line, then YOU WILL GET ZERO MARKS!&#8217;. I look around. Most people are either texting others, or dutifully copying down what is being written on the board (which itself is copied from some TextBook). I zone out again.</p>

<p>8 hours a day. Waking up everyday at an ungodly 6 AM. Around 2 Lakhs not counting auxillary expenses. 2 hour commute that makes you wish you were dead, after giving you an awful back pain. A huge set of lessons in politics.</p>

<p>I wonder what I&#8217;m getting out of this. What <em>anybody</em> is getting out of this.</p>

    <span class="post-date">Mon, Sep 6, 2010</span>

    <p>I&#8217;m blogging from Arch Linux :D</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve been meaning to setup Arch on <a href="http://yuvi.in/blog/samsung-n210-review.html">my netbook</a> for a while, after hearing a lot of people rave about how awesome <code>pacman</code> is and how fast their system is. I didn&#8217;t want to spend time on moving to a new distro during my GSoC, so I kept putting it off. Yesterday Ubuntu borked on my netbook for some weird reason (I suspect it was my friend Rathna sitting on it, but might have been because I was thinking of moving to Vim too) &#8211; and I took the opportunity to install Arch. After some messing around, and some help from #archlinux, I was able to get myself a commandline that also connected to the Internet via wifi. Yay!</p>

<p>I tried out <a href="http://lxde.org/">LXDE</a> first, instead of my usual <a href="http://www.gnome.org/">GNOME</a> &#8211; and found that it was incredibly unpolished (compared to GNOME). So after a bit of a struggle (AND READING DOCS! (and yes, my problem was dbus)), I got a minimal (very application-less) GNOME up and running. And yes, it is way faster. And yes, the packages are newer (and shinier!). And #archlinux was helpful :)</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve had to (understand and) edit a fair amount of config files to get myself a working system. It&#8217;s been a fun and informative journey &#8211; and I expect it will continue to be. My entire Linux experience so far has been with Ubuntu (hell, even the server I administer runs Ubuntu!), so coming to this world of required-and-encouraged config file editing is doing me good :)</p>

<p>I&#8217;m enjoying it :) If you&#8217;re a geek who loves fast text scrolling on an LCD (and you also have the time), you too would.</p>

    <span class="post-date">Sat, Sep 4, 2010</span>

    <p>So, I now have a motorbike!</p>

<p>It&#8217;s a <a href="http://www.google.co.in/search?q=bajaj+platina">Bajaj Platina</a>, and bought off GSoC money from my cousin <a href="http://sudarmuthu.com">Sudar</a>. I&#8217;ve been learning to ride for a while, and it&#8217;s been good. Had my first accident a while back, and started riding again a few days back.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m still very conscious about riding. I still think before clutching, braking, changing gears, etc. It hasn&#8217;t been internalized in the same way typing on a Keyboard has been &#8211; with enough practice (and accidents!) I guess I&#8217;ll be able to just &#8216;think&#8217; <em>left</em> and make my bike go left. Focus is also a major issue right now &#8211; I&#8217;ve to consciously keep reminding myself to check for everything on the road &#8211; it doesn&#8217;t quite come automatically yet. Enough time should fix this too.</p>

<p>So far I&#8217;ve logged about 12 km on the bike &#8211; and should be doing more pretty soon. The Platina is no performance bike &#8211; but it will solve my major problem of walking the last mile when using public transport. Will try posting more up-to-date &#8216;bike logs&#8217; whenever I make significant trips.</p>

<p>Will post pictures when I have a decent camera &#8211; which should also be not far off.</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: Real Bikers &#8211; don&#8217;t sneer. I&#8217;m just a noob :)</p>

    <p>Google Summer of Code ended a while back. Me (and most on #gsoc) agreed on one thing &#8211; WHERE DID THOSE 3 MONTHS GO? Amazing time it was &#8211; thanks to <a href="http://www.dgsiegel.net/">_ke</a> (Who is frolicking somewhere in Thailand right now), <a href="http://blogs.gnome.org/fargiolas/">fargiolas</a> and the rest of the GNOME guys (#clutter, #gstreamer and #gtk+ yay!) for making it awesome. #hackers-india was a great venting place too :)</p>

<p><a href="http://projects.gnome.org/cheese/">Cheese</a>&#8216;s <a href="http://git.gnome.org/browse/cheese">master</a> needs quite a bit of work before it can be included in <a href="http://live.gnome.org/ThreePointZero">GNOME 3.0</a> &#8211; and I plan on doing most of that. It&#8217;s fun &#8211; demoing it at college is a huge hit. Looks like eventually, my <a href="http://yuvi.in/blog/gsoc-2010-proposal.html">original goal</a> for Cheese might be met ;)</p>

<p>Right now, I&#8217;m decompressing, and basically not doing anything at all &#8211; except getting a bike, and sorting out some personal issues. Should be back coding (and blogging) soon. Have a huge post on GSoC experience coming up.</p>

        Work Life Balance

    <blockquote>
<p>aeoo 221 points222 points223 points 1 day ago* [-]</p>

<blockquote>
<p>recognize that work is something you do to live and isn&#8217;t your whole life</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Let&#8217;s examine this as objectively as we can manage. Lets assume a 40 hour work week where the employer pays for lunch, as the employer should be doing, which results in a real 8 hour day instead of a 9 hour day. Of course a 9 hour day will work even more in favor of my argument.</p>

<p>You need to sleep 7 to 8 hours to be healthy, on average. Let&#8217;s say 7.5. Then you need to do maintenance, such as taking a shower, getting dressed, handling bills and other inane things that can&#8217;t possibly count for having a life. Most maintenance, other than some amount of shitting and pissing, falls on the off-work time. Then you have a commute. Let&#8217;s say you have a 30 minute commute one way, which means 1 hour both ways. Let&#8217;s add up and subtract. 7.5 + 1 hour maintenance + 1.5 hours for two decent meals (breakfast and supper, and I am assuming the employer will pay for the lunch). + 1 hour commute and we get 11 hours taken up by various bullshit that we normally don&#8217;t count as &#8220;having a life.&#8221; 24 hours &#8211; 11 = 13 hours left. Out of that time, your employer gets 7 hours (because they pay for lunch, and let&#8217;s say they don&#8217;t want to count lunch as a productive hour just like we don&#8217;t count eating food as having a life on our off-work time either, which makes it fair n square), and 1 hour is &#8220;wasted&#8221; on lunch. So you are away from home for 8 hours. So (24 &#8211; 11) &#8211; 8 = (13) &#8211; 8 = 5. So you get 5 hours of time which we can describe as &#8220;having a life.&#8221; Your employer gets 7 hours, if the employer pays for lunch, as they should be doing. You lose and your employer wins when it comes to quantity.</p>

<p>If the employer refuses to pay for lunch, then you are absent from home 9 hours, then the equation becomes (24 &#8211; 11) &#8211; 9 = 4: you get 4 hours and your employer gets 8. In this case you lose much harder than in the previous case.</p>

<p>Now let&#8217;s talk about quality. Quality is just as important, if perhaps even not more important, than quantity. In most cases, for a normal scenario of a day shift, 9 to 5 shift, the quality of the 9 to 5 time slot is much, much better than the quality of the 5:30 to 10:30 slot. Why is that? It should be obvious. When you wake up, you are fresh, your mind is most clear at the beginning of the day. At work, you accumulate stress and get tired. So you come home tired and wasted after a hard day&#8217;s of work.</p>

<p>So your employer not only gets more hours on a work day, it also gets higher quality hours too. In a week there are also 2 days off. Of course on those days you also have more chores to do that you&#8217;ve been putting off on the work days, and plus you need to recuperate from all the stress you&#8217;ve been accumulating the entire work week.</p>

<p>If you&#8217;re in the USA, your vacation time is likely non-existent (2 weeks and grudgingly it increases to 3 after many years). If you&#8217;re in Europe, you probably get 1-2 months vacation time right off the bat, which goes a long way toward ameliorating the problem we are discussing. In many industries it&#8217;s also the case that even the weekend doesn&#8217;t belong to you. You are on-call, or you have to work the weekend, whatever. Having a commute that&#8217;s more than 30 minutes one way drastically alters the balance of the formula as well.</p>

<p>So, at least if you are in the USA, chances are you spent your life for the sake of the employer and not for your own sake. There is no balance to speak of. The balance is a myth and a mirage and a dream. In Europe, people may have something that resembles balance due to their more generous law-mandated vacation time and other labor protections.</p>

<p>I want what I work on to be part of my life &#8211; and not as something that I should escape from so I can have a life. I&#8217;ll make sure that&#8217;s possible :)</p>

        Cheese 2.31.1 Released
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">Thu, Jul 22, 2010</span>

    <p>If you had read my <a href="http://yuvi.in/blog/gsoc-2010-proposal.html">Cheese GSoC proposal</a>, it would&#8217;ve stressed on one major point &#8211; make Cheese sexy.</p>

<p>Two days ago, one of my classmates spent 5 minutes on the bus using Cheese and trying out different effects (and poses!). Today, my brother spent 20 minutes trying to get the perfect combination of style and vagueness for his Facebook profile picture &#8211; using Cheese. He then asked me to create an account for him in Ubuntu (he was an exclusively Win7 user till then) before leaving.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m still not where I want to be (the girls haven&#8217;t gone gaga over it&#8230;yet!), but I know very well that I am on the right path.</p>

<p>And a major milestone in that path is the release of Cheese 2.31.1. The &#8216;release&#8217; means that the code is now stable enough to be actually shown off. The major features (rewrite in Vala, use Clutter, user defined Effects and most importantly, Live Previews) are in working condition. We are no longer walking through a minefield of segfaults. You can build it and show it off. When something breaks and <a href="http://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/sources/cheese/2.31/">you tell us</a>, we&#8217;ll most probably not reply with &#8216;yeah, we know that. We&#8217;ll fix it when we get to it&#8217;. The road to Cheese 3.0 has begun.</p>

<p>So, what&#8217;s all in this release?</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Rewrite of the UI code. We removed the entire old src/ folder, and rewrote everything from scratch. Using <a href="http://live.gnome.org/Vala">Vala</a>. Why? Because ~7000 lines of C code is now ~1500 lines of Vala code. And the Vala code has more features (Live preview, for one!). The Vala compiler is pretty mature &#8211; only one &#8216;real&#8217; bug so far (rest have been mostly binding bugs, fixed with single line of code changes). And #vala has been incredibly helpful too! And we are re-using most of the &#8216;backend&#8217; code (Camera detection, pipeline linking, etc) &#8211; it is still in C, and writing Vala bindings was incredibly simple.</p></li>

<li><p>Move from Gtk to Clutter for display. Means I can do stuff like overlay semi-transparent text on top of the effects. Or have animated page transitions. Or (in the future), use OpenGL effects without having to do an extra to-fro copy from memory. Have drop shadows for everything. Make the effects tilt and rotate around when hovered over. Etc, etc, etc. Clutter is the major contributor to the &#8216;sexy&#8217; part.</p></li>

<li><p>User created effects. Effects are no longer hardcoded. A simple 4 line text file and enthusiasm for reading documentation is all that is required to create your own effect. The effects are based on GStreamer, and are very flexible &#8211; you can create something as simple as monochrome + hue, or something as complex as face detection + extra limb addition to specific people :P</p></li>

<li><p>Live Streaming &#8211; biggie. All effects are arranged in grids of 3&#215;3 in multiple pages that you can swipe through. Simply clicking one will activate it pretty much instantaneously. No more &#8216;select effect, apply, no-it-sucks, let&#8217;s go back and do it again&#8217; games :)</p></li>
</ol>

<p><a href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/8768784/cheese-midterm.ogv"><img src="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/8768784/cheese-midterm.png" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>I made a <a href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/8768784/cheese-midterm.ogv">quick screencast</a> to show the new Live preview stuff to those of you too lazy to actually get the source and compile. And the subject is a pink+green teddy bear sitting on my white netbook. (And the weird stuff that turns up after I exit fullscreen is a bug in <a href="http://recordmydesktop.sourceforge.net/about.php">RecordMyDesktop</a> &#8211; and is an incentive for you to actually <a href="http://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/sources/cheese/2.31/">get the source</a> and check it out :P)</p>

<p>These are the four <em>major</em> features that are new. All the other parts of previous Cheese UI have also been implemented (preferences, thumbnail viewer, fullscreen, wide mode, device detection, etc.)</p>

<p>As for the next release &#8211; keep looking out for it, it will land soon! It will primarily be a bug fix and code cleanup release &#8211; fixing crashes, UI inconsistencies and making sure everything works as intended.</p>

<p>A lot of late night hackery (mostly because my college takes up 10 hours of &#8216;regular&#8217; time) has gone into this release &#8211; so check it out <a href="http://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/sources/cheese/2.31/">here</a> and tell us what you think. Especially about the parts that suck. Especially useful would be if you can get someone non-technical to sit in front of Cheese, observe where all they fail (and succeed) and then report your observations back to us.</p>

<p>It is the first &#8216;real&#8217; document I&#8217;ve written &#8211; it actually had a tangible effect.</p>

<p>Now that I don&#8217;t need to make any modifications, I&#8217;ve <a href="http://yuvi.in/blog/gsoc-2010-proposal.html">moved it to my site</a>.</p>

    <p>This week on Cheese&#8230;.</p>

<p>WE MADE A RELEASE! :)</p>

<p><a href="http://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/sources/cheese/2.31/">http://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/sources/cheese/2.31/</a></p>

<p>Cheese 2.31.1 is out. It&#8217;s a dev release. Does not have zarro boogs.</p>

<p>But it is a release!</p>

<p>This week, we</p>

<ol>
<li>Fixed several perf bugs.</li>
<li>Fixed some weird preferences dialog bugs</li>
<li>Filed (and eventually had fixed) a bug in GStreamer.</li>
<li>Fixed a regression</li>
<li>Beautified the UI a bit (text name overlay of effects, etc)</li>

<li><p>Assorted administrative work to prepare for release (Copyright</p>

<p>updating, merging back into master, etc)</p></li>
</ol>

<p>I also passed my mid terms :)</p>

<p>Next week&#8230;</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Remove dependency on Mx Toolkit (it is not a blessed dependency,</p>

<p>and i&#8217;m not using large parts of it anyway)</p></li>

<li><p>Performance improvements, especially at startup time. It is taking</p>

<p><em>waaay</em> too long .</p></li>

<li><p>Fix problems in video mode.</p></li>

<li><p>Make the TODO list shorter.</p></li>
</ol>

    <span class="post-date">Mon, Jul 12, 2010</span>

    <p>This week on Cheese&#8230;.</p>

<ol>
<li>Performance enhancements. Sacrificed some startup time for <strong>much</strong> improved usage time. Viewing live effects are now a snap. So is selecting an effect. We went in some cases from ~15s to &lt;1s. Thanks to Tester (and other folks) at #gstreamer for helping out :)</li>
<li>Paging of effects. Effects are now in pages of 9 each, instead of a huge scroller area.</li>
<li>Applying effects without stopping the pipeline. Makes things much faster.</li>
<li>Implementing the popup menu for thumbnails.</li>
</ol>

<p>We&#8217;ll be making a release anytime now :)</p>

<p>All of last week&#8217;s goals were met, except the code cleanup. It will probably have to wait after release.</p>

<p>As I type this, there are 6 blockers before we can make a release. Will make a post when we do a release, hopefully with a screencast too!</p>

<p>Next week is kinda unpredictable &#8211; I&#8217;ll douse fires as they arise in the code (reported by people who hopefully test the release), and also work on reducing the length of items in the TODO.</p>

    <span class="post-date">Thu, Jul 1, 2010</span>

    <p>Late report. But I did get quite a bit done!</p>

<p>Last week&#8230;</p>

<ol>
<li>Video Effects file format reader</li>
<li>Live Preview of Effects! (YAY!)</li>
<li>Effect files added</li>
</ol>

<p>Live Preview took most of my time. We bought down CPU usage from ~90% to a more manageable ~50%. Cleaned up code a bit (still needs more cleanup). It is rather very &#8216;demoable&#8217;, provided you gloss over the slowdowns.</p>

<p>Coming up next week would be&#8230;</p>

<ol>
<li>Even less CPU Usage! We&#8217;re now even with current Cheese (which does not give you live previews). I want to bring this down even more.</li>
<li>Reduced latency for switching operations. Moving between effects/screens now has more than a second of latency. I should reduce this to much lesser than a second.</li>
<li>Code cleanup. Some of the C code is a mess &#8211; needs to be cleaned up much.</li>
<li>Error fixing. You can now crash it by looking at it at a 58 degree angle, during new moon days. Bugs like these will be fixed.</li>
</ol>

<p>Cya in a week, with a very-usable Cheese! I&#8217;ll post a screencast as soon as I&#8217;ve made Cheese a bit more sexy :)</p>

    <span class="post-date">Sun, Jun 20, 2010</span>

    <p>Fourth week of the Summer of Code was over a few days back, and this report is overdue :( I&#8217;ve not been able to code as much as I wanted to this week &#8211; due to various non-technical issues. Will compensate in the next week.</p>

<p>Last week&#8230;</p>

<ol>
<li>Countdown Animations (Thanks to _ke for cleanup!)</li>
<li>GConf Cleanup</li>
</ol>

<p>Yes, that was it.</p>

<p>Totally failed to meet last week&#8217;s goals. Sigh.</p>

<p>By next week, I hope to have accomplished&#8230;</p>

<ol>
<li>Video Effects file format reader</li>
<li>Basic Effects application to the currently playing pipeline.</li>
<li>Mockups on best weay to present effects UI to user</li>
</ol>

<p>Here is to hoping the coming week turns out better than last one :)</p>

    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">Sun, Jun 13, 2010</span>

    <p>Third week of the Summer of Code is over! And during this week&#8230;.</p>

<ol>
<li>Successfully wrapped up the core cheese functionality (<code>libcheese</code>) with a vala wrapper</li>
<li>Made Photo Mode work</li>
<li>Made Video Mode work</li>
<li>Made Burst Mode work</li>
<li>Made cheese single instance using <code>libunique</code></li>
<li>Started work on cleaning up GConf code.</li>
</ol>

<p>In <a href="http://yuvi.in/blog/cheese-gsoc-report-week-2.html">last week&#8217;s report</a>, I mentioned that I didn&#8217;t quite like my pace of work. It is still the same (approx. 3 hours a day on average, excluding overhead) &#8211; but I&#8217;ve come to accept that it is okay. No more bitching about it, as long as I&#8217;m meeting my goals.</p>

<p>Last week&#8217;s predictions were to complete libcheese wrapping, photo mode, video mode and burst mode. Set goals accomplished with ample time to spare &#8211; time that was spent trying to get countdown animations to work (still haven&#8217;t managed), and make cheese single instance. I under-estimated last week &#8211; should improve accuracy.</p>

<p>By next week, I hope to have accomplished&#8230;</p>

<ol>
<li>Fully functional preferences dialog box</li>
<li>Countdown animations</li>
<li>Full GConf integration (i.e. remember all your preferences)</li>
<li>Full blown keybindings (Basically <code>&lt;Esc&gt;</code> to cancel, since the others are already implemented)</li>
<li>Trash/Delete implementation</li>
</ol>

<p>It would have everything Cheese 2.30.1 has, except for Effects.</p>

<p>And what did I learn this week?</p>

<ol>
<li>RTFM. Again. And again. THEN ask on IRC.</li>
<li>How to use gdb. I&#8217;ve only cursorily used it before &#8211; but digging into it deeper now (thank you, segfault!)</li>
</ol>

        Cheese GSoC Report – Week 2
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">Sun, Jun 6, 2010</span>

    <p>Second week of the (rather hot and sweaty) Summer of Code is over! And during this week&#8230;.</p>

<ol>
<li>Replicated most of the UI of Cheese</li>
<li>Learnt how to make C and Vala code co-exist (Thanks folks at #vala!)</li>
<li>Made the thumbnail widget work, in both modes/orientations</li>
<li>Implemented fullscreen mode, with autohiding of the action buttons</li>
<li>Started modifying parts of libcheese to support clutter for video output</li>
</ol>

<p>In <a href="http://yuvi.in/blog/cheese-gsoc-report-week-1.html">last week&#8217;s report</a>, I mentioned that I didn&#8217;t quite like my pace of work. I <em>still</em> don&#8217;t like it &#8211; <a href="http://projecthamster.wordpress.com/">Hamster</a> reports I&#8217;ve spent 15.2 hours since Monday on Cheese, which is just about 3 hours a day! Totally unacceptable, and I&#8217;d like to increase that number considerably.</p>

<p>Last week&#8217;s predictions were for libcheese integration, UI replication and Thumbnail view implementation. I&#8217;ve finished the last two, and have made a start on the first. Needs improvement.</p>

<p>By next week, I hope to have accomplished&#8230;</p>

<ol>
<li>Working video preview showing up!</li>
<li>Photo taking works</li>
<li>Video taking works</li>
<li>Burst mode works</li>
</ol>

<p>Basically, it would be usable. In a basic way.</p>

<p>And what did I learn this week?</p>

<ol>
<li>Don&#8217;t try to be too clever. Clear Code &gt; Lesser LoC.</li>
<li>Ask first. Verify assumptions.</li>
<li>Just because something can be rewritten, does not mean it should be :)</li>
</ol>

<p>On an unrelated note, my sleep cycle is totally messed up &#8211; I&#8217;ve been sleeping at 6 AM and waking up at 2 PM. Sunlight feels weird to me. I haven&#8217;t been able to do my biweekly bicycle rides :( I should also try to fix that before the end of next week.</p>

    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">Sun, May 30, 2010</span>

    <p>First week of official coding is over. What do I have to show for it?</p>

<ol>
<li>Moved code from Github to GNOME Git (Thanks fargiolas!)</li>
<li>Learnt how to use GTKBuilder, and how to autoconnect signals to vala callback functions.</li>
<li>Learnt <em>some</em> of the intricacies of Gtk+ Layouts (They still have a lot to teach me!)</li>
<li>Got a very basic version of the basic Cheese window up and running.</li>
<li>Learnt how to embed Clutter into the Gtk+ base of Cheese.</li>
</ol>

<p>So far so good. I don&#8217;t quite like the pace of my work &#8211; I should be going faster. Hopefully I won&#8217;t be feeling like this at the end of next week :)</p>

<p>By next week, I hope to have accomplished&#8230;</p>

<ol>
<li>Pixel perfect UI, replicating exactly what is in cheese right now (except for the viewport, ofcourse)</li>
<li>Vala bindings (<code>.vapi</code> files, basically) for <code>libcheese</code></li>
<li>Thumbnail View finished (either wrap and use current code, steal some some other project or write my own)</li>
<li>Basic work on modifying libcheese to support video output to a ClutterTexture</li>
</ol>

<p>GSoC is primarily about learning, so what have I learnt so far?</p>

<ol>
<li><code>git</code> is a powerful tool, provided you do not fight it (thanks fargiolas!)</li>
<li>Just because code works, doesn&#8217;t mean it is good enough! (thanks _ke!)</li>
<li>When you are stuck, STOP AND ASK FOR DIRECTIONS! (thanks fargiolas!)</li>

    <span class="post-date">Sun, May 30, 2010</span>

    <p><strong>Note</strong>: I&#8217;m not an expert on Vala, GTK+, or anything else for that matter. If I am off base someplace, comment.</p>

<p>I spent quite a some time today trying to get GTKBuilder to automagically connect all my signals to their handlers. I tripped up at a few places, and so recording them here for posterity.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>If you are using instance methods (like most of us are), you&#8217;ve to decorate your handler function with the attribute <code>[CCode (instance_pos=-1)]</code>. This makes sure that the function is passed the <code>this</code> pointer as last argument, rather than first. You&#8217;ve to do this because <code>Builder.connect_signals</code> passes the instance as last parameter (<code>user_data</code>), and by aligning your <code>this</code> pointer with <code>user_data</code>, you make sure the correct instance is called.</p></li>

<li><p>Make sure your handler function signature matches what is expected. Ignore the <code>user_data</code> parameter of most signals &#8211; it is used internally by <code>Builder.connect_signals</code> (see above point).</p></li>

<li><p>Make sure you pass <code>--pkg gmodule-2.0</code> to your <code>valac</code>. If you&#8217;re using Autotools, this means you pass it to <code>VALAFLAGS</code>.</p></li>

<li><p>sure your C compiler is called with <code>-dynamic-export</code>. I&#8217;m told this enabled support for <code>dlopen</code> in the binary produced.</p></li>

<li><p>Mangle your names properly. <code>Cheese.MainWindow.on_quit()</code> becomes <code>cheese_main_window_on_quit</code> on C, and that is what GTKBuilder expects. If you are not sure how your function name is mangled by <code>valac</code>, checkout the generated <code>.c</code> file.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>If you do all these 5 things right and you&#8217;re still having trouble, turn up on #vala at irc.gimp.net and ask the helpful folks there :)</p>

        GSoC Milestones – Vala Build using AutoTools
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">Thu, May 6, 2010</span>

    <p><em>I&#8217;m using a <a href="http://www.rememberthemilk.com/home/yuvipanda/13485943/">RTM List</a> to track my milestones for this <a href="http://yuvi.in/blog/gsoc-2010-the-beginning.html">my GSoC</a> this year. I&#8217;ll be making a blog post for each item ticked off that list, to share what I&#8217;ve learnt in my journey from n00b to someone whose code is good enough to be included in GNOME. This is part 1 in the series, where I tell you about autotools</em></p>

<p>My GSoC project involves, moving major parts (UI) of Cheese to a new language &#8211; <a href="http://live.gnome.org/Vala">Vala</a>. Vala is more an extremely glorious C preprocessor than a language of its own &#8211; it just translates down to GObject based C code, rather than bytecode/objectcode. The syntax is very C#ish &#8211; I was using <a href="http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/CSharpMode">csharp-mode</a> in emacs to code vala till I got bored enough to download <a href="http://live.gnome.org/Vala/Emacs">vala-mode</a>. It&#8217;s got closures &#8211; haven&#8217;t used them yet, here is to hoping they&#8217;re real closures. It has <em>tons</em> of libraries &#8211; it takes a few (minutes|hours) to write a binding for any C library, so many bindings already exist. You don&#8217;t lose speed &#8211; Vala is compiled down to C code. It also has one of Java&#8217;s suckiest features &#8211; <em>Checked Exceptions</em>. The documentation is non existent &#8211; you&#8217;ve to pretty much read through the bindings, or the original C library&#8217;s documentation to get anything done. And not many people know such a language exists (<a href="http://kausikram.net/">Kausik</a> for example &#8211; but he also didn&#8217;t know you could output pdf from latex, so I don&#8217;t think his opinion counts :D)</p>

<p>Cheese uses autotools for building. I had to tweak their script to make it build my Vala code as well. I&#8217;ve never worked with any of the autotools stuff before &#8211; I didn&#8217;t even know <code>.ac</code> stood for <code>autoconf</code> and <code>.am</code> stood for automake. No big deal &#8211; Google knows it all and will tell you for free. I JFGI and found a bunch of articles about using autotools to successfully build vala projects. After reading <a href="http://www.lrde.epita.fr/~adl/autotools.html">this monstrous (180+ slides, but ~500 pages) Autotools presentation</a> (which is actually very, <em>very</em> good, btw), I had a working build script. It built my single <code>cheese.vala</code> file that did nothing but run a loop and wait to be terminated. It had a place where I could add more <code>.vala</code> files and they should (should) be included in the build. It was hackish, but like most hacks, it worked. <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2007/03/the-works-on-my-machine-certification-program.html">On My Machine</a>&trade;.</p>

<p>Nowhere else. Turned out my script wasn&#8217;t working at all &#8211; just faking it to me. I had initially tested out <code>valac</code> (the vala compiler), which had produced a <code>.c</code> file. Since <code>make</code> was supposed to produce the same file, and it wasn&#8217;t stale (I hadn&#8217;t touched my <code>cheese.vala</code>), it just proceeded to compiling the <code>.c</code> files with <code>gcc</code>. The Vala part of the build script wasn&#8217;t being executed at all. Removing the <code>.c</code> file told me that my hackish script hadn&#8217;t worked at all.</p>

<p>After banging my head for a while to figure out <em>why</em> it wasn&#8217;t working, I finally landed up on the official autotools docs. Autotools had added <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/hello/manual/automake/Vala-Support.html">native vala support</a>. The hack I found was not necessary.</p>

<p><em>facepalm</em></p>

<p><strong>Moral of the Story</strong>: RTFM comes first, not JFGI.</p>

<p>Anyway, I rewrote the build script to be much more cleaner in a couple of minutes. And it worked.</p>

<p>Build systems are actually a lot of fun once you get the hang of it. A black screen with fast scrolling green text cryptic to everyone else but totally sensible to you is incredibly attractive, no? :)</p>

<p>So, what exactly does <a href="http://gist.github.com/356202">my proposal</a> mean for Cheese?</p>

<ol>
<li>Moving the UI to <a href="http://live.gnome.org/Vala">Vala</a> (from C)</li>
<li>Move display bits from <a href="http://www.gtk.org/">GTK+</a> to <a href="http://clutter-project.org/">clutter</a></li>
<li>Implement Live Preview to show people how applying an effect will look before applying it</li>
<li>Implement loadable effects so you aren&#8217;t stuck with just 12 preloaded effects.</li>
</ol>

<p>I&#8217;m told that the scope is kinda too big for 3 months &#8211; but I&#8217;m sure that with careful planning (hah!), around 40 hours of work a week (haha!), lots of time away from college (hahaha!) I can do this stuff :)</p>

<p>I&#8217;m keeping my code in a <a href="http://github.com/yuvipanda/cheese">github repo</a>, so watch that for code updates. And will be updating this blog at the completion of every milestone, so subscribe if you haven&#8217;t :)</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: My exams are still going on. Won&#8217;t be coding much till they end (May 19th).</p>

<p><a href="http://gist.github.com/356202">Link to my, uhm, <em>cheesy</em> proposal</a></p>

<h3 id="what-now">What Now?</h3>

<p>Getting accepted doesn&#8217;t mean shit. Actually finishing whatever I was supposed to within 3 months does mean <em>something</em> &#8211; especially since I&#8217;ve taken on quite a bit of stuff to do (Move to new language + 2 new features). I&#8217;m quite the n00b &#8211; first time I&#8217;ll be doing just <em>one</em> thing over 3 months. Will be setting up a way of monitoring progress (probably via set milestones) soon enough. Will keep this place posted :)</p>

<p>Also, say Hi to my mentor <a href="http://home.cs.tum.edu/~siegel/">daniel siegel</a>. Him and fellow cheese-dev <a href="http://blogs.gnome.org/fargiolas/">Flippio Argiolas</a>, who were extremely helpful in getting my proposal whipped into shape (It&#8217;s a gist, so you can see how it eveolved over time).</p>

<p>The Oscar acceptance style blog post will be turned in once the three months are over and the newer, improved Cheese is accepted as good enough :D</p>

    <p>Quoting from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Levy">Steven Levy</a>&#8216;s <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/729">Hackers</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>[..] a project undertaken or a product built not solely to fulfill</p>

<p>some constructive goal, but with some wild pleasure taken in mere</p>

<p>involvement, was called a &#8220;hack.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Building things for the fun of building them is hacking. And <a href="http://db.glug-bom.org/lug-authors/philip/docs/hackers-not-crackers.html">hacking is not illegally breaking into computers</a>.</p>

<p>I like hacking. I want to be a real hacker. I can&#8217;t call myself one yet.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m putting this up as a reminder to myself &#8211; about what is important and what isn&#8217;t. Here is to hoping I remember to say <em>No</em> more often. Here is to hoping that the next time I&#8217;m bored, I write something rather than idle on IRC. GSoC (a bigger post about it coming up) is helping &#8211; a lot.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ll do a monthly &#8216;things I&#8217;ve hacked on&#8217; post, and see how many things turn up on that :)</p>

        PyCon India 2009
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">Mon, Apr 19, 2010</span>

    <p><strong>Warning</strong>: Rambling, <em>unedited</em>, 7 month old recollection ahead. Proceed at your own risk.</p>

<p>Ah, PyCon India 2009. My first solo bit of travel outside Chennai. What fun it was :) Though it was almost 7 months ago, most of the memories are still fresh. Compare that to college, where I struggle to remember what happened last week&#8230;</p>

<p>Anyway, it was fun. I went off by bus with the rather interesting Anirudh &#8211; a profitable startupeer and someone I met when working with <a href="http://busroutes.in">Busroutes.in</a>. He has a finances related degree and his startup deals with (rather cool) car electronics. He was also a KDE contributor, and is a very interesting travel partner for reasons too numerous to mention here.</p>

<p>I spent some time at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lal_Bagh">Lalbagh</a>, roaming around by myself (and texting classmates with my legs hanging off a cliff-type place). Was fun! I&#8217;d definitely do that again &#8211; the place was extremely peaceful.</p>

<p>I stayed at <a href="http://sudarmuthu.com">Sudar</a>&#8216;s place. Staying at a bachelor&#8217;s place was fun &#8211; guess that was how my room would look like if I was left all to myself. It was, however, definitely too organized for my tastes &#8211; you could actually walk without accidentally stepping on stuff ;) He&#8217;s grown up too fast &#8211; he actually dragged me to a food place and forced me to have breakfast!</p>

<p>Hung around mostly with mech-yet-wannabe-geek <a href="http://kausikram.net">Kausik</a> (who once famously said that he &#8216;doesn&#8217;t want to use LaTeX for resumes because most people ask for docx or pdf&#8217;), Anirudh and Sudar (who was there only for Day 1). Had a longish talk with <a href="http://lawgon.livejournal.com/">Kenneth</a>, who I later found out was quite a celebrity on IRC/Mailing Lists. Meeting people you knew onlyine online IRL is unsettling at first.</p>

<p>The event itself went well. I was inside only for a couple of major talks &#8211; the one about waffle by <a href="http://twitter.com/cnu">cnu</a> is the only thing I could remember. I was mostly out in the corridors, typing out code in (one of the many) laptops that Sudar has. The lightning talks were way more fun &#8211; because they were only 15 mins or so long and packed a lot of tech (I particularly remember the one about Python internals by <a href="http://artagnon.com/">artagnon</a> and one about a GAE app by <a href="http://blog.ideamonk.in/">ideamonk</a>. I gave one too &#8211; the last one, so I had no projector, no working laptop, no mic, oh and Kausik who was supposed to present with me ditched me in the last minute :P It still went exceedingly well &#8211; it was my first time ever talking on a stage of any stage outside college and the practice I had from giving them in college (Thanks to <a href="http://dorai.wordpress.com/">Dorai</a> and the iCell) helped a ton. I even cracked quite a few jokes that was recieved well. Fun times &#8211; and I guess it finally killed the last remaining bits of my &#8216;shit, you aren&#8217;t really expecting me to go up there and talk, are you?&#8217; feelings developed from school days :)</p>

<p>Before I left, I visited <a href="http://bitterscotch.wordpress.com/">planemad</a> at <a href="http://bangalore.nid.edu/">NID</a>. Awesome place. Someday, I hope someone established a National Institude of Programming at such a scenic place, where people can come together and learn about <em>programming</em> rather than <em>engineering</em> (which is just college-management-speak for <em>IT Industry Zombie Production Factory</em>)</p>

<p>There you go! That&#8217;s a rambling account of my PyCon India 2009 experiences. Next one is probably going to be in Chennai &#8211; looking forward to that!</p>

        Samsung N210 Review
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">Fri, Mar 12, 2010</span>

    

<p>I bought a brand new Samsung N210 Netbook about two weeks back &#8211; and have been using it almost non-stop since. I&#8217;ve been taking it to college every day, using it at every oportunity I get &#8211; on the college bus, on MTC buses, on the train, while waiting for the train, hell even <em>during</em> a rather very boring class!</p>

<h3 id="the-great">The Great</h3>

<ul>
<li>The Screen! The <strong>matte</strong> screen is totally awesome. Viewable under all conditions &#8211; full on sunlight during a train commute or at a weird angle snuggled under the desk during class. It is sharp, and IMO has enough resolution (1024&#215;600). The bezel is small and not very distracting.</li>
<li>The Keyboard. 94% of a full size keyboard, I&#8217;m told. It is extremely comfortable, and I don&#8217;t miss too many keys. I do find the right shift absolutely useless though. The chicklet keys look great too</li>
<li>The Looks. One guy asked me if I was carrying a white MacBook.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="the-good">The Good</h3>

<ul>
<li>The Touchpad. It is large and the mouse buttons are not bad. I don&#8217;t know if it supports two button finger scroll on Linux &#8211; but it does work on Windows. My hands do accidentally touch it often while typing, moving my cursor unexpectedly &#8211; but I have been able to stop that by using my right thumb for space instead of my left.</li>
<li>The Battery. I seem to get around 8 hours of usage under varying circumstances and conditions &#8211; while nothing to laugh at, I was expecting more. Might be because I haven&#8217;t been able to figure out a way to turn off the wifi chip from Linux.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="the-bad">The Bad</h3>

<ul>
<li>The Heat. The fan isn&#8217;t very noisy, but the heat buildup is appreciable. I can&#8217;t really work with it directly on my lap.</li>
<li>The inbuilt webcam. 0.3 Megapixels. Bleh!</li>
<li>WiFi. Drops <em>very</em> often, and not very sensitive. Ubuntu Autodetected it though.</li>
<li>The SD Card Slot. It has a cover that comes right off, and I guarentee I&#8217;ll lose it in a while.</li>
<li>Many of the Function Key functions aren&#8217;t supported on Linux. Was able to make the Brightness keys work after a hack though.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="the-awful">The Awful</h3>

<ul>
<li>The ugly black sticker ad for <em>&#8220;Phoenix Hyperspace&trade; Instant-on&#8221;</em>. Ewww! Atleast there is only one big sticker spoiling this white beauty</li>
</ul>

<p>Was it worth the 20k bucks I paid for it? I&#8217;m typing out this blog post while waiting at my Doctor&#8217;s, so I&#8217;d say it <em>is</em> well worth the 20k bucks paid :)</p>

        “We must take [India] as it is” – Jules Verne
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">Thu, Mar 11, 2010</span>

    <p>I&#8217;ve gotten back to reading fiction ever since I got my netbook (review comin up!). <a href="http://gutenberg.org">Project Gutenberg</a> has been very helpful. Jules Verne&#8217;s <em>Adventures of a Special Correspondent</em> was the first one I completed. It is a good book &#8211; but not phenomenal. It does have a few very good moments, and one of them hit extremely close to home.</p>

<p>Towards the end, when <em>Claudius Bombarnac</em> rumbles about how the Chinese do not make full use of the engine&#8217;s power &#8211; always keeping it running at 40 mph even though it could be pushed to do way more.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;I agree with you, but where you have a railway you might as well get</p>

<p>all the advantage out of it that you can.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Bah!&#8221; said Pan-Chao carelessly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Speed,&#8221; said I, &#8220;is a gain of time&#8211;and to gain time&#8211;&#8220;</p>

<p>&#8220;Time does not exist in China, Monsieur Bombarnac, and it cannot exist</p>

<p>for a population of four hundred millions. There would not be enough</p>

<p>for everybody. And so we do not count by days and hours, but always by</p>

<p>moons and watches.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Which is more poetical than practical,&#8221; I remark.</p>

<p>&#8220;Practical, Mr. Reporter? You Westerners are never without that word in</p>

<p>your mouth. To be practical is to be the slave of time, work, money,</p>

<p>business, the world, everybody else, and one&#8217;s self included. I confess</p>

<p>that during my stay in Europe&#8211;you can ask Doctor Tio-King&#8211;I have not</p>

<p>been very practical, and now I return to Asia I shall be less so. I</p>

<p>shall let myself live, that is all, as the cloud floats in the breeze,</p>

<p>the straw on the stream, as the thought is borne away by the imagination.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I see,&#8221; said I, &#8220;we must take China as it is.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>India too, as I see it from where I am, is pretty similar. Practacality can go shoot itself in the head.</p>

<p>What do I gain by copying stuff from the board to the notebook? Nothing, but do it anyway because <em>that is how it has always been done</em>.</p>

<p>Why should I go back 10 years by not using a mobile phone? Because we aren&#8217;t good enough to hold your attention long enough, so we are going to force you to not do anything else even if you are going to be bored to death (even if literally).</p>

<p>Why should I use Turbo C, even though it is extremely antique and doesn&#8217;t really conform to any standards? Because that is what the people setting the syllabus learnt! (Nothing personal, TC.exe &#8211; just that I hope people stop believing Windows was written in Java/VB because <code>you can do GUIs only in those!</code>)</p>

<p><em>Doesn&#8217;t matter if there is a better way, if it is not the way it is done. Conservatism. Bah</em></p>

<p>I&#8217;m talking only from my point of view, from where I have been (apparently) hurt. I am sure this is not the only place &#8211; this happens everywhere. Anti-Change Conservatism. Which I am told, is not even the true meaning of the word <code>conservatism</code>. I hope someone sometimes explains to me what the word was supposed to mean, and how it came to represent parents who won&#8217;t let their kids out to have fun with their friends.</p>

<p>Good news is, trains in China are no longer run at a max of 40 mph. Change does occur, but it takes time, and hurts those who live during it. We are those people. I hope.</p>

    <span class="post-date">Tue, Jan 26, 2010</span>

    <p>I had my first ever dream in binary today.</p>

<p>The cycle moved like this:</p>

<p>Borg -&gt; nanoprobes -&gt; a scene in Minority Report when nanobots go around looking for John Anderton (Tom Cruise), who was hiding in a bathtub full of water -&gt; Will Smith and his Dog cuddling in a bathtub in I am Legend -&gt; the climax of I am Legend when Will Smith blows himself up to save the others -&gt; A column of binary numbers came up, showing state of Will Smith as &#8216;SAD&#8217; AND <strong>MSB FLIPPED TO ZERO</strong>, and then he has this epiphany (Realization of God Moment) and becomes &#8216;HAPPY&#8217; and the <strong>MSB FLIPS TO ONE</strong>.</p>

<p>WTF? Shouldn&#8217;t he be sad when the MSB is at one (Negative) and happy when it is at zero (Positive)?</p>

<p>Note for Non-CS folks: MSB -&gt; Most Significant Bit, the left-most bit in a binary sequence. Usually, setting it to zero means the number is positive, and setting it to 1 means it is negative.</p>

    <p>The measure of code quality is <a href="http://www.osnews.com/images/comics/wtfm.jpg">WTFs/minute</a>.</p>

<p>I just realized, after a rather intriguing facebook conversation with <a href="http://shiv.me">Shiva</a>, that the only true measure of learning is <strong>Epiphanies per Session</strong>.</p>

<p>My <a href="http://twitter.com/yuvipanda/status/7673895360">latest Epiphany</a> was a couple of days back. And the one before that was a month or so back, when I was &#8216;pairing&#8217; with <a href="http://siddhi.blogspot.com/">Sid</a>. I think the one before that was quite some time back &#8211; when I understood the true meaning of closures. And a few &#8220;Yes, it is not just me&#8221; moments when talking with <a href="http://sriramkrishnan.com">SriramK</a>.</p>

<p>College is yet to give me a technical one. It has given me a lot of emotional ones though. Maybe someone could chuck the totally pointless part of what we call college (the supposedly technical part (where they give you xeroxes of shittily written programs that often don&#8217;t compile and give you a banana if you are able to copy it perfectly on to the screen (a task at which, many <em>CS students</em> fail))) and keep just the useful parts.</p>

    <span class="post-date">Mon, Jan 4, 2010</span>

    <p>I was writing a post on how 2009 ended. Here is the tl;dr version: It was my &#8216;growing-up&#8217; year in Tech, and &#8216;roller-coaster&#8217; year in personal stuff. There! I&#8217;m certainly significantly wiser at the end of 2009, and that is due more to my state at the beginning of 2009 than at the end :) Good enough</p>

<p>So how did I celebrate? By joining the KPP <em>competition</em> at Kurukshetra. That&#8217;s what I did at around 12 on New Year&#8217;s. Not intentionally, mind you. Just happened.</p>

<p>Then, on 2nd Jan, I did something interesting. On a whim, I took my bicycle, and rode an hour in traffic. Alone. To Marina Beach.</p>

<p>And then I spent the next hour sitting near the waves. Looking around. Just enjoying myself. And then rode back home, and for the first time in over 4 years, slept before 12.</p>

<p>I did it again the next day. With a friend this time. My knees were already killing me since I practically had no physical activity before this. But I still did it again. My knees would literally kill me now if they had a way to.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m happy. Teen Angst has taken a break :)</p>

<p>Let this year be the one when I remove external dependencies on my happiness :)</p>

        The Python Workshop
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">Tue, Dec 8, 2009</span>

    

<p>We had a python <em>workshop</em> at college a week back.</p>

<p>One hellova workshop it was! <a href="http://kausikram.net/">Kausik</a> conducted it, and about 14 people turned up (We picked 15, one girl had to miss it &#8216;coz of fever). Every single one of them was there because they wanted to be there. This happened during semester holidays, so they came to college just for this. And from the feedback (and the actions that followed it) I got, it was worth their while.</p>

<h3 id="teaching-python">Teaching Python</h3>

<p><a href="http://kausikram.net/">Kausik</a> did all the hard work, with me just going around helping people get unstuck. Watching people when they suddenly <em>get it</em> is a really amazing feeling.</p>

<p>The hardest part for many people was not the significant whitespace (most intuitively got it, we didn&#8217;t even have to repeat it once). It was the concept of explicit <code>self</code>. And the biggest (though not exhaustive) selling points were, in no particular order: Lack of the semicolon, no boilerplate code (type declarations, etc) and support for arbritarily large numbers. <code>pointers</code> are conspicous by their absence.</p>

<h3 id="so-what-did-you-guys-cover">So, what did you guys cover?</h3>

<h4 id="day-1">Day 1</h4>

<ul>
<li><code>&quot;Hello World!&quot;</code></li>
<li>Conditionals, Looping constructs</li>
<li>Functions</li>
<li>Lists, Dictionaries and Tuples</li>
<li>Basics of OOP (Classes, Objects, and explicit <code>self</code>)</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="day-2">Day 2</h4>

<ul>
<li>Using Google to find docs</li>
<li>The <code>datetime</code> module</li>
<li>Using <code>easy_install</code> to install external libraries</li>
<li>Exploring docs of <code>python-dateutil</code> module</li>
</ul>

<p>Pretty much zero time was spent lecturing, and most time was spent actually doing things. Just as how things should have been :)</p>

<h3 id="following-up">Following up</h3>

<p>The best thing about this workshop was it did not end at closing time Day 2. It went on. We are now planning on a weekly programming competition at college, with cash prizes (sponsored by the college and <a href="http://dorai.wordpress.com/">Mr. Dorai Thodla</a>). And several people have taken up solving problems on <a href="http://projecteuler.net">Project Euler</a>, and we have a working game done by one of the students. That isn&#8217;t the end &#8211; one team is hoping to replace the antiquated VB6-ish management system in our library with one built in django, while another is trying to automate attendence systems using SMS.</p>

<h3 id="inspiration">Inspiration</h3>

<p>So, how did it all get started? The inspiration? <a href="http://yuvi.in/blog/what-i-learnt-from-the-hackfest-at-iitm.html">Hackfest</a>. Huge thanks to <a href="http://arun.chagantys.org/">vimzard</a>, <a href="http://kstars.wordpress.com/">kstar</a> and the rest of the Hackfest team who were our inspiration. I hope there is a Hackfest next year too, and that some (a lot!) of our students are more than good enough to attend and make meaningful contributions. It changed me this year, and it should continue to shape and change more people throughout the years :)</p>

<p>And ofcourse, no small thanks to <a href="http://dorai.wordpress.com/">Dorai Thodla</a>, who helped get this entire iCell thing off the ground, and Ms. Sumathi Poobal &amp; Mr. Ramanayagam from our college, without whose participation the iCell would&#8217;ve died a silent death. (What&#8217;s this iCell thingy anyway? A post for some other time :) )</p>

<p>I didn&#8217;t happen to forget <a href="http://kausikram.net/">someone</a> whose name began with a K, did I?</p>

    <p>Commitment.</p>

<p>I keep jumping around. My <a href="http://github.com/yuvipanda">GitHub</a> profile is proof for that. So are the large number of projects I&#8217;ve taken up only to leave in the middle. Unless and until I fix my commitment issues, I&#8217;ll be just-another-guy-who-learnt-to-code-in-his-teens, not the-guy-who-changed-the-world. Just reading a lot of stuff isn&#8217;t going to do me <em>any</em> good unless I actually get off my ass and do something.</p>

<p>Hopefully, putting this up in public will make it more real. Maybe I&#8217;ll be shamed into being more committed to whatever I choose to commit to.</p>

<p>It is good to jump ship when it is sinking, as long as you know where you want to go.</p>

        Block cursor vs Post Cursor (gVim vs Emacs)
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">Wed, Oct 28, 2009</span>

    <p>Here is an approximate timeline of the <strong>editors</strong> I&#8217;ve used so far:</p>

<ul>
<li>Turbo C++ (4th grade to 8th grade)</li>
<li>Visual Basic 6 (8th grade to 10th grade)</li>
<li>Visual Studio 2005 (10th grade to 11th grade)</li>
<li>Visual Studio 2008 (11th grade to 1st year of college)</li>
<li>gVim (1st year of college)</li>
<li>GNU Emacs (after gVim)</li>
</ul>

<p>Now, the one thing, maybe even the <em>only</em> thing I miss is the fact that gVim gives me the I-Bar cursor, while Emacs by default gave me the block cursor. I like the I-Bar better than the block, and so far, couldn&#8217;t figure out how to change that. It&#8217;s not helping that I don&#8217;t have access to the internet.</p>

<p>So what does a sane man do?</p>

<p>He stops using the GTK version of Emacs, and switches to the console version :D</p>

    <p>So, I wake up at noon.</p>

<p>And my phone doesn&#8217;t work.</p>

<p>Then I find out my Internet doesn&#8217;t work.</p>

<p>Then I find my TV&#8217;s crapped.</p>

<p>Then I find that I&#8217;ve to go to college tomorrow.</p>

<p>The last thing is good. The others aren&#8217;t. Oh well.</p>

        Anatomy of an impromptu hackathon (Git vs SVN)
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">Wed, Oct 21, 2009</span>

    

<p>One of the (good) things that came out of the <a href="http://yuvi.in/blog/what-i-learnt-from-the-hackfest-at-iitm.html">IIT Hackfest</a> was me hanging out on the #hackers-india IRC channel. It is wild, swingy and usually fun. Usually.</p>

<p>So yesterday night, <a href="http://ideamonk.blogspot.com/">ideamonk</a> casually mentioned that he was working on something called <a href="http://github.com/yuvipanda/pymos">pymos</a>. It was a python script that made mosiacs. Now that was something I was totally interested in &#8211; I tried making a similar &#8216;script&#8217; a long time back (in C#), and totally utterly failed, simply because I was so caught up with the part that downloaded pictures from flickr that I didn&#8217;t do the part that generated the actual Mosaic. Since ideamonk&#8217;s code already generated the mosaics (and since it was in Python), I forked it, and began to work on the to do items.</p>

<p>Note that ideamonk and I don&#8217;t know each other (we were apparently sitting next to each other at PyCon India &#8217;09, but that doesn&#8217;t count!). We were on the channel, he&#8217;s commented on my blog once, and that&#8217;s about it. But still, we worked together all night fixing code. I could bore you with details of the work that was done within the next five or so hours (1 AM &#8211; 6 AM), but I will just point you to to this <a href="http://github.com/ideamonk/PyMos/network">commit graph</a> generated by GitHub. There was a flurry of commits, and there should be a tagged version up for download (and on PyPI) soon.</p>

<h4 id="if-not-for-github-8230">If not for github&#8230;</h4>

<p>Let us, for a moment, assume that this code was on, say, <a href="http://code.google.com">Google Code</a> instead of <a href="http://github.com">GitHub</a>. How could I have contributed?</p>

<ol>
<li>Checkout the code via SVN</li>
<li>Fix one thing</li>
<li>Send ideamonk a patch file (I can&#8217;t commit anything anywhere!)</li>

<li><p>Wait for him to:</p>

<p>4a. Open up his mail client</p>

<p>4ai. Get lost in <a href="http://programming.reddit.com">proggit</a> (or <a href="http://facebook.com">FaceBook</a>)</p>

<p>4b. Grab the patch file</p>

<p>4c. Apply patch</p>

<p>4d. Test things to make sure I didn&#8217;t break things</p>

<p>4e. Wonder if the code is good enough to be merged in</p>

<p>4f. Commit code with my patch in it</p>

<p>4g. Notify me that my patch is in, so i can do an svn up</p></li>

<li><p>Go to 2</p></li>
</ol>

<p>No code gets committed, simply because step 4 is a huge involvement for ideamonk. Knowing that step 4 is a huge involvement for ideamonk is a huge block for me too. Obviously, he&#8217;d rather be coding than dealing with patches. Who wouldn&#8217;t? Being a developer &gt; Being a maintainer. One of the reasons I respect maintainers of projects a lot.</p>

<p>Now, how does it work with github?</p>

<ol>
<li>I fork <a href="http://github.com/ideamonk/pymos">it</a> (1 click)</li>
<li>Fix one thing</li>
<li>Commit, Push to <a href="http://github.com/yuvipanda/pymos">my repo</a></li>
<li>If there is something significant in, notify ideamonk to pull from me. Else go to 2.</li>
</ol>

<p>Much simpler, and note that all four are things <strong>I could do myself</strong>. Nothing depends on ideamonk. Maintainence works is almost zero. Nobody has keys to the cathedral, since this is not one.</p>

<h4 id="please-put-your-code-on-github">Please put your code on GitHub</h4>

<p>It has the least amount of friction for developers looking to contribute, and the least amount of work for you as maintainer. Thanks!</p>

        Why I got rid of my fork of Waffle

    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">Wed, Oct 21, 2009</span>

    <p>For those of you who didn&#8217;t know, <a href="http://github.com/bickfordb/waffle">Waffle</a> is a <a href="http://bret.appspot.com/entry/how-friendfeed-uses-mysql">schemaless storage layer</a> that sits on top of SQLAlchemy. Something that I was initially very interested in.</p>

<p>Not anymore.</p>

<p>Why?</p>

<p>Because I found <a href="http://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/Home">MongoDB</a>.</p>

<p>And fell in love.</p>

<p>Yes, I do know they both are different, but MongoDB has the things that attracted me to Waffle (very flexible schema, great querying, indexes) and is just as easy to set up (maybe not as easy as Waffle over SQLite, but only slightly less easier).</p>

<p>I &lt;3 MongoDB. Let&#8217;s see how long this lasts!</p>

        What I learnt from the Hackfest at IITM
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">Wed, Oct 7, 2009</span>

    

<p>I was about to just type a list of stuff here, but that doesn&#8217;t do the topic justice. So here I am, at 3:30 in the morning, sleep cycle screwed up by the Hackfest, typing out a post on what all I learnt from there. I spent pretty much my entire awake-time at the IIT, so it helped me a lot.</p>

<h4 id="your-college-doesn-8217-t-matter-much">Your college doesn&#8217;t matter much</h4>

<p>IIT Envy. Every non-IITian has that. I spent a lot of time at IITM during the Hackfest, and while my IITEnvy did go up during the first few hours, it initially came down well below normal as I got to know the people better. What was cool about them was not <em>where they were studying</em>, but <em>what they were doing</em>. I could do what these guys were doing. Anyone can do what these guys were doing &#8211; there is nothing special about the IIT except maybe for the fact that it aggregates naturally dedicated people into pools. You don&#8217;t need an IIT for that &#8211; IRC will do :) I&#8217;m from a teeny college that nobody has heard of &#8211; that would have been a problem when people judged people by where they studied, rather than by what they did. Should not be a problem for me now :)</p>

<h4 id="real-c-isn-8217-t-hard">Real C isn&#8217;t hard</h4>

<p>I was utterly clueless about GTK+ when I landed up at the IIT. The first thing I told <a href="http://arun.chagantys.org/blog/">Arun</a> was that I was clueless about C and maybe would like to hack on something in C# or Python.</p>

<p>I thought I was clueless about C. All I had done was TurboC &#8211; which I had not really considered as <em>real</em> C till that point. However, an hour into the hackfest, I realized something &#8211; Pointers and Structures are all you need! Read the docs, read some good code, and you are done. I will probably do what I usually do to learn a new language &#8211; write a significant amount of useful code in it &#8211; in C very soon.</p>

<h4 id="code-talks">Code talks</h4>

<p>I don&#8217;t have any patches against my name. The only significant piece of code I think I have written so far is this blogging engine you are reading. That needs to change.</p>

<p>Doesn&#8217;t mean I have to churn out code like a copier machine &#8211; I just have to have enough things to point to and be able to proudly say &#8216;I did that&#8217;. Great Documentation, proper deployment options and a little evangelism helps too. None of my code has any of that. That has to change too.</p>

<h4 id="know-tools-well">Know tools well</h4>

<p>I use Emacs. But not to its fullest potential. Same thing for pretty much all of my tools &#8211; Bash/Powershell, Build Tools, etc. Heck, I can&#8217;t even write a shell script to save my life! That has to change, and change fast. I smell perl.</p>

<h4 id="people-on-irc-are-friendly">People on IRC are friendly</h4>

<p>I&#8217;ve always been a lurker on IRC, just listening and not daring to speak. That changed <em>drastically</em> once I actually met these really nice people in person &#8211; so I can see my IRC usage going way up! It has also expanded my horizons quite a bit &#8211; meeting new people, getting to know people better, constantly being challenged to actually get off my ass and write some stuff, etc.</p>

<h4 id="todo">TODO</h4>

<ul>
<li>Read more code. File bugs. Try to fix bugs.</li>
<li>Learn Perl. Learn C. Learn C++. Get much better at Python.</li>
<li>Go through my <a href="http://github.com/yuvipanda">code</a>, document all the necessary parts, create home pages for the significant ones.</li>
<li>IRC more. I have been &#8211; the last two days have seen my IRC usage skyrocket.</li>
<li>Stop cribbing about my life and get on with it!</li>
</ul>

    <p>I&#8217;m going to participate in <a href="http://www.shaastra.org/2009/site/events/coding/hackfest">Hackfest</a> at IITM&#8217;s Shaastra, starting tomorrow. Will hopefully be a lot of fun &#8211; and may I be able to contribute my first ever patch during the event ;) Got permission to not get back home &#8211; but wondering, where would I stay? Probably pass out in front of the computers :)</p>

<p>I&#8217;ll be hackin on GNOME Apps &#8211; hopefully <a href="http://banshee-project.org/">Banshee</a> (since that&#8217;s one app I <strong>love</strong>), or write a newish, smallish app with PyGTK. Anything would do but :)</p>

<p>Will be blogging more &#8211; Sadly, no camera, so no pictures :(</p>

<p>Anyone else coming along?</p>

<p>Code I have written so far:</p>

<ol>
<li><a href="http://github.com/yuvipanda/HiSlain">HiSlain</a>: A static blog publishing system (NOT A DJANGO BLOG!). Runs this blog</li>
<li><a href="http://github.com/yuvipanda/wtfimb">wtfimb</a>: The code that powers <a href="http://busroutes.in">Busroutes.in</a></li>

<li><a href="http://github.com/yuvipanda/sadivy">SadIvy</a>: A pure WSGI URL Shortener</li>
</ol>

<p>Now, I&#8217;ve been doing a shit job of documenting them &#8211; none exists. Nor of writing tests &#8211; none exists. That should hopefully change soon :)</p>

<p>HiSlain and reappy are where I&#8217;m going to concentrate my efforts on for the next month or so.</p>

<h4 id="task-list-for-hislain">Task List for HiSlain</h4>

<li>Add support for raw, unmanaged pages</li>
<li>Port a decent looking, simple theme to HiSlain</li>
<li>WRITE DOCUMENTATION!</li>
<li>Write some tests, and refactor the code to make it more testable</li>
<li>WRITE MORE DOCUMENTATION!</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="task-list-for-reappy">Task List for reappy</h4>

<ul>
<li>Write a real application with it, so bugs can be fixed in the process</li>
<li>DOCUMENTATION!</li>

<li>MORE DOCUMENTATION!</li>
<li>Examples.</li>
</ul>

<p>And ofcourse, new sub-pages over here for both of them (atleast). Stay tuned!</p>

<p>Her waitress uniform made her look cuter than ever. He knew he had to ask her out. He drummed up enough courage, went to her and said &#8216;Hi&#8217;.</p>

    <p>He was sitting in class. Bored. He looked around. He saw sixty other people, but felt alone. He stood up, shouted &#8216;Why am I here?!? This won&#8217;t do!&#8217; and walked out of the class, leaving everyone confused and weirded out.</p>

<p>He moved out of the campus, and saw sixty thousand other people. He still felt alone. He realized the problem is not the world, but him. Within the next few hours, the problem went away. Forever.</p>

        Picks from autogenerated Freya Quotes (NSFW?)
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">Mon, Jul 20, 2009</span>

    <p>I love autogenerating text.</p>

<p>So I ran <a href="http://www.freya.in/">Freya&#8217;s Blog</a> through a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain">markov chain</a> text generator, and it came up with a ton of potentially funny quotes that had me in splits for a while. Here are the best:</p>

<ol>
<li>They say its gonna kill me</li>
<li>But still, his eyes are in no way good.</li>
<li>Thank God I never pick it up.</li>
<li>But hello, which parent accompanies a full-grown daughter to her lover</li>
<li>When you win, nobody knows that she&#8217;s thinking of marriage.</li>
<li>He&#8217;ll persuade me somewhow and then copy-paste this.</li>
<li>And I&#8217;m blogging with a heavy suitcase full of new clothes (which aren&#8217;t really comfortable and I wasn&#8217;t flat-chested) but not sweet! Um..well..the dress isn&#8217;t bad but I was embarrassed.</li>
<li>My Friend deserves better, so finally we&#8217;re here in the future.</li>
<li>I didn&#8217;t want Economics, so they grow, safely and sweetly blossoming. By this time, the camera broke.</li>
<li>It broke because, well, he was gorgeous!</li>
<li>Considering the fact that I would&#8217;ve sat without realising that 59 people registered for the ball, gowns etc. But that&#8217;s very few blogs.</li>
<li>Her reason ultimately was, you don&#8217;t really like the designs. But that&#8217;s what women want for being in a relatioship.</li>
<li>If a women got molested, then she finally said &#8220;Okay, dear, I will have to pay so far and she still lurves him</li>
<li>That&#8217;s stupid.</li>
<li>If anyone has the official cleavage showing license, I don&#8217;t. Now, it&#8217;s not falling.</li>
</ol>

<p>I swear these are all authentic computer produced text, and I think they <em>do</em> have a &#8216;freya&#8217; feel to them. Don&#8217;t they?</p>

<p>Now, if there&#8217;s enough interest, I might even make this into a website, that throws you a quote everytime you hit it :P Or maybe I should target some other blogger? (/me eyes <a href="http://sathyanarain.com">Sathya</a>)</p>

    <p>I&#8217;ve been hacking &#8217;round with <a href="http://github.com/yuvipanda/HiSlain">HiSlain</a>, and wrote a syntax highlighting plugin for it. Nothing fancy &#8211; just uses <a href="http://pygments.org">Pygments</a>, but the process of modifying the plugin architecture to support this has been an awesome ride. I&#8217;ll probably open up a new GitHub project just for HiSlain Themes and Plugins.</p>

        Treat of a Lifetime
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">Sat, Jul 4, 2009</span>

    <p>I promise her &#8216;the Treat of a Lifetime&#8217;. I cook up a reason realistic enough for her to buy it. I bribe off everyone else to make sure she is alone. And she is.</p>

<p>We walk along the sides of a typical city street. She is talking &#8211; she always is. When has she ever been quiet? Quiet is an adjective one doesn&#8217;t use with the noun &#8216;girl&#8217;. And she&#8217;s no ordinary girl. She is my girl. Atleast, I hope she will be. I hope to know in a few hours.</p>

<p>Pizza Hut is in sight. She expects me to take her there. But I don&#8217;t. I take her hand in mine and take a right turn, into a broken down building. She is surprised, but does not resist.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why hiding? Any of your relatives passing by?&#8221;</p>

<p>I like her talking style. I like her accent. Is there anything about her I don&#8217;t like?</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I am taking you to the treat&#8221;</p>

<p>A &#8216;wtf&#8217; look consumed her face. She looks cuter than ever. When has she ever looked not-cute?</p>

<p>Before she could do or say anything, I reach for the remote in my pocket and activate the holodeck.</p>

<p>Within a second, we are at a beach. I can see a bunch of whales diving around at a short distance. Nobody was within eyesight. The sun was just about to set, and the waves reached just a few feet from our feet.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where the hell are we?&#8221; She is confused and anxious. But not afraid. When has she ever been afraid of anything? Afterall, I fell for her &#8211; she can not possibly be afraid of anything.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is Southern California, about 50,000 years before we were born&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Riiiiight. Who are you, a Q? You can&#8217;t transport people back in time!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ofcourse I&#8217;m not a Q, dumbo. I can&#8217;t transport people back in time. I just recreated the beach in that old building. We never left that old building &#8211; this is that old building&#8221;</p>

<p>Within a few sentences I explain to her how a holodeck can create any place we can imagine, and how I used it to make sure that the treat is, indeed, The Treat of a Lifetime.</p>

<p>She had a hard time believing it. With the gentle wind against her beautiful face blowing her hair up in a really, really cute way, even I have trouble believing that this was not a real beach.</p>

<p>We start walking. Nobody speaks. The only sounds are the waves crashing and the distant whales.</p>

<p>I can&#8217;t bear it anymore. I have to tell her, and now.</p>

<p>&#8220;Remember the first day we met? At the Milan Cultural Festival?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure I do! You were making a big fuss about not getting the top place in photography&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Remember what you said that day?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Huh?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You said you would be the happiest person on earth if you found a mermaid who could gift you a gold fish&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Huh? WTF are you memorizing these for?&#8221; Another slight arch of her forehead.</p>

<p>I try to keep myself composed. &#8220;Well, look there&#8221;</p>

<p>I point at the sea.</p>

<p>A mermaid crawls on to the sand. She has a bowl with a golden fish in it.</p>

<p>&#8220;OMG What the hell did you do that for?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I did it because I want you to be the happiest person in the world. Because I love you. I love you&#8221;</p>

<p>A tear rolls out of my eye. I had just said what I had been hoping to say since I first met her 3 years ago.</p>

<p>Things seem to happen in slow motion. The breeze made her hair look damn cute. The setting sun made her beautiful face seem like a spectacular miracle. These few moments, from the time I closed my mouth and she opened hers, seems like an eternity. An eternity I could live with.</p>

<p>A tear rolled out of her eye too. It sparkles like the diamond it was.</p>

<p>&#8220;All these years, I was waiting for you to say it first&#8221;</p>

<p>My heart skips a beat. She has said yes. She is my girl. Finally, someone who loves me as much as I love them!</p>

<p>Three hours later, the holodeck is powered down and she returns home.</p>

<p>I get beamed back to Voyager. Duty awaits.</p>

    <span class="post-date">Thu, Jul 2, 2009</span>

    <p>It started when <a href="http://sathyanarain.com/">@msnarain</a> pinged me one day and asked if I could help out with a small project involving twitter. I asked how small &#8211; and he described what would later on become <a href="http://novelrace.in">http://novelrace.in</a>. It ended up being pretty small &#8211; about 150 lines of code, excluding styles and stuff. Not bad, eh?</p>

<p>Oh, and if you have no idea what novelrace is &#8211; <a href="http://aditya.wordpress.com/2009/06/09/novelrace/">this post</a> should clear things up. And yeah, I too tried participating (<a href="http://yuvisense.net/emacs.html">story 1</a>, <a href="http://yuvisense.net/cute-dress.html">story 2</a>, both written late at night), but I write crap :( Maybe some other time&#8230;</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: According to <a href="http://www.dwheeler.com/sloccount/">this</a>, the worth of 150 lines of Py code is ~4,000$! That much for a few days of coding? SERIOUSLY?</p>

    <p>Should I tell her?</p>

<p>I shouldn&#8217;t.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t even know her. She&#8217;s new in class. So am I. We&#8217;re all new in this class. We are first years, at the first day of college.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t even know her name! And she obviously doesn&#8217;t know my name. We are, for all intents and purposes, complete strangers in the same class.</p>

<p>What if she takes it seriously? I&#8217;ll probably be branded the classholic flirt of the class, and never be taken seriously ever again. I&#8217;ll be banned, and I can&#8217;t even use a sock puppet!</p>

<p>But, she doesn&#8217;t look like the type who take it seriously. Now, <em>that</em> girl over there? The type to take things seriously. I&#8217;d probably get a sternly worded letter from her dad if I so much looked at her. And a few broken bones if I tried talking. Meh.</p>

<p>But her. She doesn&#8217;t look anything like that at all. I could see her laughing with her nascent <em>friends</em>. Over some piece of silly joke probably. Or maybe a comment about some guy. Who knows! Just one of the things girls normally just laugh about and then say &#8216;what? nothing&#8217; when you ask them about it later. There&#8217;s probably a term for that. &#8216;Sweet nothings?&#8217; I don&#8217;t know. Ask a girl.</p>

<p>Maybe I should just go and tell her. It&#8217;s no big deal. It&#8217;s not like nobody ever does stuff like this. Yeah, it&#8217;ll be the first time for me, but heck! Everyone has a first time! I&#8217;ll probably get used to it.</p>

<p>Okay, I&#8217;ll just walk up to her, say &#8220;Hi&#8221;, and then say it. No big deal. If it works, it works. If it doesn&#8217;t, it doesn&#8217;t. Big deal!</p>

<p>I walked up to the gang of giggles. &#8220;Hey!&#8221;. I got an enthusiastic, sweet sounding &#8220;Hey!&#8221; back.</p>

<p>Wow, awesome voice! Now, not to lose composure. Just say it already goddarn it!</p>

<p>&#8220;Pretty dress you&#8217;ve got!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Awww cute! Thank you!&#8221;</p>

<p>Wow, that &#8216;omg squeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee&#8217; voice again. Seriously? It&#8217;s almost like speaking to a grown up kid! But I&#8217;ve got to say it!</p>

<p>&#8220;Just the dress&#8221;</p>

<p>(<em>And thus began the most vile, spineless, soulless part of his life. And NO, you do not want to know how it ended</em>)</p>

    <p>He was coding.</p>

<p>He was on a bus, and coding. He had bought himself a cute little black Netbook just so he could open up Vim on a bus and code Python. He is a geek. A young, 18 year old typical geek. As typical as your usual geek.</p>

<p>The bus was quite empty. It was late at night, this was proably the last bus for the day, and except the Driver &amp; Conductor, there were probably 4 people on the bus. Including our geek.</p>

<p>That was until she got in.</p>

<p>She was younger than him. And pretty. Not pretty as in a &#8216;OMG Dude that chick is HAWT!&#8217; pretty, but pretty as in &#8216;Wow, isn&#8217;t she darn beautiful?&#8217; pretty. She looked out of place in that shabby bus, alone at the late hour. Like someone had embedded a beautiful snippet of Python inside a messy tangle of Java written by an ex-VB developer who learnt programming in Turbo C.</p>

<p>He saw her. &#8220;Nice hair&#8221;, he thought. And went back to coding.</p>

<p>Five silent minutes went past.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wow, what a Vim user! In the wild!&#8221;</p>

<p>He was startled. He was &#8216;in the zone&#8217;, and when you&#8217;re the zone, everything outside your screen is just a blur. The blur slowly started sharpening itself.</p>

<p>He turned back. It was her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Huh?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Your editor? It&#8217;s Vim&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Huh huh?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So you&#8217;re not a real programmer. <a href="http://www.xkcd.net/378/">Real programmers use emacs</a>&#8220;</p>

<p>&#8220;Eh?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And <a href="http://bit.ly/realprogrammerspython">real programmers don&#8217;t use Python</a> either. <a href="http://www.ericsink.com/entries/c_morse_code.html">We code in C</a>&#8220;</p>

<p>&#8220;Erm, wha? Huh?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, C. And Emacs. Vim is for Wimps. You would probably run windows on that thing if you could&#8217;ve. You are a total waste of space&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What the?&#8221;</p>

<p>She timed it to perfection. The bus stopped. She got down, blew him a kiss, and went on her merry way.</p>

<p>&#8220;Damn! She&#8217;s a programmer, a girl, my age, who does emacs vs vim, AND I DIDN&#8217;T GET HER NUMBER!&#8221;</p>

<p>(Partially inspired by <a href="http://xkcd.com/377/">this</a>. It first went off into a wild arc involving a Ruby script written to generate Python code <em>cough</em>, but then I decided against including that)</p>

<p>(And yes, obviously, comments welcome. <a href="http://novelrace.in">#novelrace</a> helped me get off my ass and start writing, so I&#8217;ll be producing crap for some time now. But still, call crap crap :) )</p>

<p>I&#8217;m Yuvi. This is my second blog. My old one has been retired because, well, it&#8217;s old! It contained too much ranting. It has content from me since I was 14 &#8211; a lot of that is just plain stupid, and a few are even embarassingly inaccurate &amp; naive. You can still possibly checkout the <a href="http://blog.yuvisense.net">old blog</a> &#8211; if I manage to get the content back :)</p>

<p>This new blog will be about me. My Code. .NET. Python. Mono. Maybe some Linux, and perhaps Ruby. My College. Human Stupidity. Fun. My Life. My Pictures. Possibly my Stories. Ofcourse, stuff too short for this will be over at <a href="http://twitter.com/yuvipanda">my twitterstream</a> :)</p>

<h4 id="the-statbot">The Statbot</h4>

<p><a href="http://thestatbot.com">TheStatBot.com</a> is being retired.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t have enough time on my hands to maintain that seperately. I originally wanted to develop StatBot as a brand of it&#8217;s own, but I now have no time on my hands to do so. I have an internship coming up (more details later), have another one slated to start in 3 months, and hell just turned down one more! And ofcourse, there is <a href="http://busroutes.in">busroutes.in</a>, <a href="http://novelrace.in">novelrace.in</a>, and a bunch of other community sites I&#8217;m involved in, along with <a href="http://github.com/yuvipanda">my open source projects</a>.</p>

<p>And ofcourse, I have college life to attend to &#8211; and believe me, I&#8217;m having tons of fun. Yes, I do have a social life &#8211; I never thought I&#8217;ll have one till I joined this particular college. I hope to leave the college in a better state than when I entered it, and so am taking an active interest in developing it. And the management is awesome enough to let me help. So that takes up my time too!</p>

<p>I can honestly claim to not have the time to maintain the statbot brand :(</p>

<p>However, doesn&#8217;t mean I&#8217;m going to stop doing stats! I &lt;3 stats &#8211; I&#8217;ve just got a book from my (awesome) college library so I could start learning &#8216;proper&#8217; statistics instead of just drawing graphs and looking for co-relations. And ofcourse, the code I use for stats (<a href="http://github.com/yuvipanda/goodfather">goodfather</a>, named after my awesome friend <a href="http://lagesse.org">Rob</a>) is also being actively developed, and is in it&#8217;s sixth (and possibly last) rewrite (maybe another blog post some other day about the number of rewrites).</p>

<p>Expect more stats posts. They&#8217;ll be on this blog too! I promise!</p>

<h4 id="blog-platform">Blog Platform</h4>

<p>This blog <em>runs</em> on <a href="http://github.com/yuvipanda/hislain">code</a> I personally wrote. The first piece of code that I&#8217;m using in a &#8216;production&#8217; environment. I&#8217;m pumped! There will be bugs, and I will kill them. One.By.One :)</p>

<p>Okay, back to work now. More blog posts hopefully coming soon!</p>

        Optimizing Life

    <p><a href="http://www.cforcoding.com/2009/06/do-programmers-optimize-life.html">Geeks Optimize Life</a>. True that. I do optimize the short route from when I get down from my college bus to my home, and me and <a href="http://sudarmuthu.com/blog">Sudar</a> did have an argument about optimization when we took the train together one day. My argument was that the distance you are going to walk is constant anyway (you either walk it at the station you are boarding the train, or where you are getting down), so moving to the extreme end of the train is pointless. He pointed out that if you walk when you are at the boarding station, you are using your <em>idle time</em> &#8211; time spent waiting for train to arrive (kinda like how the CPU can do stuff when waiting for IO to complete). However, time after you reach your destination is <em>not</em> idle time &#8211; you are not waiting for anything, so you should minimize the distance you have to walk before you can get out of the station and continue to whatever you have to do next. He was right, so I stfu :)</p>

<p>(Ofcourse, sometimes you want to actually <em>maximize</em> time spent walking &#8211; in that case, move to the wrong extreme end, and when (and if) asked, just act confused. Works :)</p>

<p>In the comments there, <a href="http://www.cforcoding.com/2009/06/do-programmers-optimize-life.html?showComment=1245689548116#c5549841120766090734">Rich</a> says that human social interaction/norms are so ineffecient we tend to optimize them out. However, I find that more often than not, it is not that human social interactions are ineffecient &#8211; they are just difficult to quantify. We sometimes mistake <code>undefined</code> for <code>zero</code>, and optimize it out. We shouldn&#8217;t. Converting <code>null</code> to <code>zero</code> is stupid. I hope I can stop doing that.</p>
