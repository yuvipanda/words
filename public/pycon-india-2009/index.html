Ah, PyCon India 2009. My first solo bit of travel outside Chennai. What fun it was :) Though it was almost 7 months ago, most of the memories are still fresh. Compare that to college, where I struggle to remember what happened last week&#8230;
Anyway, it was fun. I went off by bus with the rather interesting Anirudh &#8211; a profitable startupeer and someone I met when working with Busroutes." />

  <p><strong>Warning</strong>: Rambling, <em>unedited</em>, 7 month old recollection ahead. Proceed at your own risk.</p>

<p>Ah, PyCon India 2009. My first solo bit of travel outside Chennai. What fun it was :) Though it was almost 7 months ago, most of the memories are still fresh. Compare that to college, where I struggle to remember what happened last week&#8230;</p>

<p>Anyway, it was fun. I went off by bus with the rather interesting Anirudh &#8211; a profitable startupeer and someone I met when working with <a href="http://busroutes.in">Busroutes.in</a>. He has a finances related degree and his startup deals with (rather cool) car electronics. He was also a KDE contributor, and is a very interesting travel partner for reasons too numerous to mention here.</p>

<p>I spent some time at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lal_Bagh">Lalbagh</a>, roaming around by myself (and texting classmates with my legs hanging off a cliff-type place). Was fun! I&#8217;d definitely do that again &#8211; the place was extremely peaceful.</p>

<p>I stayed at <a href="http://sudarmuthu.com">Sudar</a>&#8216;s place. Staying at a bachelor&#8217;s place was fun &#8211; guess that was how my room would look like if I was left all to myself. It was, however, definitely too organized for my tastes &#8211; you could actually walk without accidentally stepping on stuff ;) He&#8217;s grown up too fast &#8211; he actually dragged me to a food place and forced me to have breakfast!</p>

<p>Hung around mostly with mech-yet-wannabe-geek <a href="http://kausikram.net">Kausik</a> (who once famously said that he &#8216;doesn&#8217;t want to use LaTeX for resumes because most people ask for docx or pdf&#8217;), Anirudh and Sudar (who was there only for Day 1). Had a longish talk with <a href="http://lawgon.livejournal.com/">Kenneth</a>, who I later found out was quite a celebrity on IRC/Mailing Lists. Meeting people you knew onlyine online IRL is unsettling at first.</p>

<p>The event itself went well. I was inside only for a couple of major talks &#8211; the one about waffle by <a href="http://twitter.com/cnu">cnu</a> is the only thing I could remember. I was mostly out in the corridors, typing out code in (one of the many) laptops that Sudar has. The lightning talks were way more fun &#8211; because they were only 15 mins or so long and packed a lot of tech (I particularly remember the one about Python internals by <a href="http://artagnon.com/">artagnon</a> and one about a GAE app by <a href="http://blog.ideamonk.in/">ideamonk</a>. I gave one too &#8211; the last one, so I had no projector, no working laptop, no mic, oh and Kausik who was supposed to present with me ditched me in the last minute :P It still went exceedingly well &#8211; it was my first time ever talking on a stage of any stage outside college and the practice I had from giving them in college (Thanks to <a href="http://dorai.wordpress.com/">Dorai</a> and the iCell) helped a ton. I even cracked quite a few jokes that was recieved well. Fun times &#8211; and I guess it finally killed the last remaining bits of my &#8216;shit, you aren&#8217;t really expecting me to go up there and talk, are you?&#8217; feelings developed from school days :)</p>

<p>Before I left, I visited <a href="http://bitterscotch.wordpress.com/">planemad</a> at <a href="http://bangalore.nid.edu/">NID</a>. Awesome place. Someday, I hope someone established a National Institude of Programming at such a scenic place, where people can come together and learn about <em>programming</em> rather than <em>engineering</em> (which is just college-management-speak for <em>IT Industry Zombie Production Factory</em>)</p>

<p>There you go! That&#8217;s a rambling account of my PyCon India 2009 experiences. Next one is probably going to be in Chennai &#8211; looking forward to that!</p>
