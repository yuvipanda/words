                    <p>I promise her &#8216;the Treat of a Lifetime&#8217;. I cook up a reason realistic enough for her to buy it. I bribe off everyone else to make sure she is alone. And she is.</p>

<p>We walk along the sides of a typical city street. She is talking &#8211; she always is. When has she ever been quiet? Quiet is an adjective one doesn&#8217;t use with the noun &#8216;girl&#8217;. And she&#8217;s no ordinary girl. She is my girl. Atleast, I hope she will be. I hope to know in a few hours.</p>

<p>Pizza Hut is in sight. She expects me to take her there. But I don&#8217;t. I take her hand in mine and take a right turn, into a broken down building. She is surprised, but does not resist.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why hiding? Any of your relatives passing by?&#8221;</p>

<p>I like her talking style. I like her accent. Is there anything about her I don&#8217;t like?</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I am taking you to the treat&#8221;</p>

<p>A &#8216;wtf&#8217; look consumed her face. She looks cuter than ever. When has she ever looked not-cute?</p>

<p>Before she could do or say anything, I reach for the remote in my pocket and activate the holodeck.</p>

<p>Within a second, we are at a beach. I can see a bunch of whales diving around at a short distance. Nobody was within eyesight. The sun was just about to set, and the waves reached just a few feet from our feet.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where the hell are we?&#8221; She is confused and anxious. But not afraid. When has she ever been afraid of anything? Afterall, I fell for her &#8211; she can not possibly be afraid of anything.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is Southern California, about 50,000 years before we were born&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Riiiiight. Who are you, a Q? You can&#8217;t transport people back in time!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ofcourse I&#8217;m not a Q, dumbo. I can&#8217;t transport people back in time. I just recreated the beach in that old building. We never left that old building &#8211; this is that old building&#8221;</p>

<p>Within a few sentences I explain to her how a holodeck can create any place we can imagine, and how I used it to make sure that the treat is, indeed, The Treat of a Lifetime.</p>

<p>She had a hard time believing it. With the gentle wind against her beautiful face blowing her hair up in a really, really cute way, even I have trouble believing that this was not a real beach.</p>

<p>We start walking. Nobody speaks. The only sounds are the waves crashing and the distant whales.</p>

<p>I can&#8217;t bear it anymore. I have to tell her, and now.</p>

<p>&#8220;Remember the first day we met? At the Milan Cultural Festival?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure I do! You were making a big fuss about not getting the top place in photography&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Remember what you said that day?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Huh?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You said you would be the happiest person on earth if you found a mermaid who could gift you a gold fish&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Huh? WTF are you memorizing these for?&#8221; Another slight arch of her forehead.</p>

<p>I try to keep myself composed. &#8220;Well, look there&#8221;</p>

<p>I point at the sea.</p>

<p>A mermaid crawls on to the sand. She has a bowl with a golden fish in it.</p>

<p>&#8220;OMG What the hell did you do that for?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I did it because I want you to be the happiest person in the world. Because I love you. I love you&#8221;</p>

<p>A tear rolls out of my eye. I had just said what I had been hoping to say since I first met her 3 years ago.</p>

<p>Things seem to happen in slow motion. The breeze made her hair look damn cute. The setting sun made her beautiful face seem like a spectacular miracle. These few moments, from the time I closed my mouth and she opened hers, seems like an eternity. An eternity I could live with.</p>

<p>A tear rolled out of her eye too. It sparkles like the diamond it was.</p>

<p>&#8220;All these years, I was waiting for you to say it first&#8221;</p>

<p>My heart skips a beat. She has said yes. She is my girl. Finally, someone who loves me as much as I love them!</p>

<p>Three hours later, the holodeck is powered down and she returns home.</p>

<p>I get beamed back to Voyager. Duty awaits.</p>
