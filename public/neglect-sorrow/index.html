			 	<h1>Neglect and Sorrow</h1>
			  <span class="post-date">Mon, Oct 22, 2012</span>
			      <p>SumaStorm was my desktop computer. She died a slow, silent and agonizing death over the past few months, which came to light only today. Due to my neglect, she is dead today.</p>

<p>I built SumStorm with my own hands, bought with my own money (thanks to several amazing people on the web) when I was 16 or so. It felt amazing when I first booted it up. It felt amazing when I maxed out all its cores running distcc with my netbook. It felt amazing that I could run Photoshop in a Win7 VM on Ubuntu and not feel a stutter.</p>

<p>It was an amazing machine.</p>

<p>I felt horrible when I realized the extent of the damage the rats had done. This must be how kid feel when the pet dog they grew up with dies. When run over by a tank. Which the kid was driving.</p>

<p>I did not know I could be this attached to a machine. It turned out to be a very emotional few hours.</p>

<p>RIP SumaStorm. I&#8217;m sorry.</p>
