      <description>My GStreamer 101 presentation at GNOME.asia was very wel received. I was quite happy with the way it turned out. Thanks to Ford_Prefect and Bharath Acharya for pulling me in :)
My very minimal slides are here. You can reuse them if you want to.
Sadly, missed the week long hackfest :( Next time!</description>
