      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update:&lt;/strong&gt; As usual, &lt;a href=&#34;http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2636486&#34;&gt;good comments at HN&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I’ve been trying to put it in words for a while, and failing utterly every time. &lt;a href=&#34;http://swombat.com/&#34;&gt;swombat&lt;/a&gt; gets to the crux of it wonderfully:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;At the same time, something really bothered me about my work. &lt;strong&gt;It felt pointless.&lt;/strong&gt; One project I did (whose output was basically a PPT and Word document outlining the successes and failures of a client project), which took two and a half months, had, as its only apparent purpose, the promotion of the person who had led the project. Accenture was paid (quite well) so that I would sit there and produce a piece of paper that justified this person’s promotion.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
