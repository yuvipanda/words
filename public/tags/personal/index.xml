      <description>&lt;p&gt;I went to the protests at SFO last weekend. It was the first real set of protests I&amp;rsquo;ve been to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was there for about 10h on day 1, and came home exhausted. I went back on Day 2, and this time stayed for much shorter period of time (~4h?) before heading back home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I woke up that saturday feeling very depressed, angry, and helpless. By sunday night, I was only depressed and angry - but not helpless. The number and variety of people at the protests was very heartwarming, and made me feel distinctly not alone. Before going I was not sure what going to a protest accomplishes. I still do not know - but I know it gave me hope. Maybe that is good enough?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everyone who was at the protest even if it does not directly affect you yet - thank you!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I promise I&amp;rsquo;ll continue doing all I can, even and especially when it is about things that do not affect me yet. I hope you do too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First they came for the Muslims and we said &amp;ldquo;not this time, motherfucker.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;- from a sign at the protest&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
