      <description>I went to the protests at SFO last weekend. It was the first real set of protests I&amp;rsquo;ve been to. I write this to attempt to capture a sliver of what I felt that day.
I was there for about 10h on day 1, and came home exhausted. I went back on Day 2, and this time stayed for much shorter period of time (~4h?) before heading back home.
To everyone who was at the protest even if it does not directly affect you yet - thank you!</description>

      <description>HP:MOR is an awesome fanfic that anyone intent on improving themselves should read. It&amp;#8217;s a bit like HHG2G &amp;#8211; you don&amp;#8217;t read for the storyline (which is jumbled) but for the characters, wit, rationality and humor. Quite a few of those things hit very close to home &amp;#8211; if you are a geek, they would perhaps to you too. Highly reccomended.
Of the many quotable parts of that book, here&amp;#8217;s one little nugget I found:</description>

      <description>5 years ago, I was in my 10th and new on the Internet. I had been coding for about 5-6 years already, but mostly with TurboC and VB6/C# (thanks to MSDN CDs I steal from Sudar). And then this interview happened and pushed me farther out into geekland :)
Presenting a reprint from 2006, my interview with Sriram Krishnan, then Microsoftie. Note that the opinions here are of a Sriram 5 years ago, and do not necessarily represent what he thinks now :D And the questions are obviously the questions a younger, naiver (and stupider) Yuvi would&amp;#8217;ve asked, so bear with that.</description>
