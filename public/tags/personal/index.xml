      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;why-write-this&#34;&gt;Why write this?&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This August / September, I had a lot of life changes in one go:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Moving from an apartment i disliked to one I absolutely love, and maybe even feel at home in, for the first time in my life&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Officially switch jobs, becoming an employee of a non-profit I had co-founded&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Catch COVID for the first time and recover from it, with appropriate MH breakdowns from the isolation&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Get on &lt;a href=&#34;https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/meds/a601059.html&#34;&gt;Guanfacine&lt;/a&gt; as a non-stimulant medication for ADHD&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;While I can not fully separate the effects of these changes, the overall effect has been very good for me. The ADHD meds form an important and specific component, and I think I am primarily writing this to understand what that is. Many years ago, I had started on bipolar 2 meds and anti anxiety meds at the same time, and attributed some positive changes to the bipolar 2 meds that were not true - it was almost exclusively the anti anxiety meds. This contributed to me living with a misdiagnosis for many years, and taking meds I just didn&amp;rsquo;t need. So I don’t want to unconditionally say all the good positives in my life are from this, but recognize that &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; are, especially this time we did not mix it with another pharmacological intervention. Writing it down now should also allow me to come back to it a year or two later to see how that has evolved&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Note Taking Part I</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I am trying to find a nice way to keep thoughts, ideas and notes outside my head for a few months now.&#xA;I worked my way through many applications, trying to use the system they promote as the basis for my own. Along the journey, I got a better sense of what was important to me in such an application. I&amp;rsquo;ll walk through the various applications I&amp;rsquo;ve tried, along with the criteria I&amp;rsquo;ve developed by the end&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>I miss blogging too</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This person &lt;a href=&#34;http://tttthis.com/blog/if-i-could-bring-one-thing-back-to-the-internet-it-would-be-blogs&#34;&gt;misses blogs a lot&lt;/a&gt;.&#xA;So do I. I made many frients, built myself a platform, and expressed myself in ways I do not feel&#xA;like I can anymore on my various blogs. Some of them are lost to time, but some are there if you know&#xA;how to find it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Part of it was where my life was - I had time, nobody physically nearby I jived with, and a&#xA;&lt;strong&gt;lot&lt;/strong&gt; of angst. But now, I have too little time, and too many (hah!) wonderful people I enjoy&#xA;interacting with on a 1-1 basis, nearby or not. Plus, with the death of blogging platforms&#xA;(Medium is a publishing platform, not a blogging one), content is harder to find. As the author&#xA;points out,&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>my first protest</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I went to the protests at SFO last weekend. It was the first real set of protests I&amp;rsquo;ve been to. I write this to attempt to capture a sliver of what I felt that day.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I was there for about 10h on day 1, and came home exhausted. I went back on Day 2, and this time stayed for much shorter period of time (~4h?) before heading back home.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To everyone who was at the protest even if it does not directly affect you yet - &lt;em&gt;thank you&lt;/em&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Our Greatest Fear – ‘Flash and Fade’</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5782108/1/Harry_Potter_and_the_Methods_of_Rationality&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;HP:MOR&lt;/a&gt; is an awesome fanfic that anyone intent on improving themselves should read. It’s a bit like HHG2G – you don’t read for the storyline (which is jumbled) but for the characters, wit, rationality and humor. Quite a few of those things hit very close to home – if you are a geek, they would perhaps to you too. Highly reccomended.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Of the many quotable parts of that book, here’s one little nugget I found:&lt;/p&gt;</description>
