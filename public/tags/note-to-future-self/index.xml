      <description>Dear Future Me,
I know you don&amp;#8217;t want to pre-book travel tickets. You tell yourself that you like the sense of adventure and uncertainity that it gives you. You tell yourself that you need these life expriences.
But I know the truth, ofcourse. You&amp;#8217;re just plain ol&amp;#8217; lazy. Too lazy to book your damn tickets. So, get off your ass and book them now. I&amp;#8217;ll promise you that I&amp;#8217;ll hunt you through time and kill you.</description>
