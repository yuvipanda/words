      <description>I earlier had a vaguely working setup for making sure browsers, shells and other applications don&amp;rsquo;t eat all RAM / CPU on my machine with systemd + sudo + shell scripts.
It was a hacky solution, and also had complications when used to launch shells. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t passing in all the environment varialbes it should, causing interesting-to-debug issues. sudo rules were complex, and hard to do securely.
I had also been looking for an excuse to learn more Golang, so I ended up writing systemd-simple-containment or ssc.</description>

      <description>Update: There&amp;rsquo;s a follow-up post with a simpler solution now.
Ever since I read Jessie Frazelle&amp;rsquo;s amazing setup (1, 2, 3) for running GUI applications in docker containers, I&amp;rsquo;ve wanted to do something similar. However, I want to install things on my computer - not in docker images. So what I wanted was just isolation (no more Chrome / Firefox freezing my laptop), not images. I&amp;rsquo;m also not as awesome (or knowledgeable!</description>
