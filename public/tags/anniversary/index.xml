      <description>&lt;p&gt;It was exactly six years ago that I started blogging. &lt;a href=&#34;http://yuvipanda.blogspot.com/2005/05/introduction.html&#34;&gt;My first blog post&lt;/a&gt; ow seems to be rather childish, but considering I was 14 then, maybe it is excusable :)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I’ve moved across several blogging platforms and urls in the meantime (&lt;a href=&#34;http://yuvipanda.blogspot.com&#34;&gt;Blogspot&lt;/a&gt;, wordpress and now &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/yuvipanda/hislain&#34;&gt;my own custom engine&lt;/a&gt;. I’ve sadly lost a good portion of my blogs thanks to a domain loss and a server crash. Sigh.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Also, looks like I’ve been writing code for almost eleven years now! Not counting my turboC years, that would be 8 years now. Not bad, eh? I’ve been coding for more than 60% of my life :)&lt;/p&gt;</description>
