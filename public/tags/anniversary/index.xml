      <description>It was exactly six years ago that I started blogging. My first blog post ow seems to be rather childish, but considering I was 14 then, maybe it is excusable :)
I’ve moved across several blogging platforms and urls in the meantime (Blogspot, wordpress and now my own custom engine. I’ve sadly lost a good portion of my blogs thanks to a domain loss and a server crash. Sigh.
Also, looks like I’ve been writing code for almost eleven years now!</description>
