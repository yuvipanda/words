      <description>Just finished reading &amp;#8216;Javascript &amp;#8211; The Good Parts&amp;#8217;. Here is what I learnt:
 I knew jack shit about JavaScript. I was able to get along so far simply because I knew jQuery and understood how closures work. Holy shit that&amp;#8217;s one fucked up language. Quite schizophrenic, saved by almost limitless extensibility/monkey-patchability/watcha-gonna-do-write-a-java-applet-hahaha . If you&amp;#8217;re going to write Javascript, you&amp;#8217;ll have to subset. Subsetting/augmenting has its own share of problems &amp;#8211; primarily that map in your code might not be the same as map in someone else&amp;#8217;s code, even if they seem to be working on the same &amp;#8216;type&amp;#8217; jQuery is incredible.</description>
