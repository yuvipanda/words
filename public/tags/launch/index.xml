      <description>(Leave comments or discuss this post on the jupyter discourse)&#xA;nbgitpuller is my most favorite way to distribute content (notebooks, data files, etc) to students on a JupyterHub. The student mental model is &amp;lsquo;I click a link, and can start working on my notebook&amp;rsquo;, which is as close to ideal as we have today. That is possible since all the information required for this workflow is embedded in the link itself - so it can be distributed easily via your pre-existing communication channel (like email, course website, etc), rather than requiring your students to use yet another tool.</description>
