      <description>&lt;p&gt;Note: I am just reformatting + putting this in one piece rather than have it split across multiple comments on reddit. Am not the original author&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/n1ddk/why_i_will_never_feel_threatened_by_programmers/c35juok&#34;&gt;Beautifully laid out by someone&lt;/a&gt; in the under-trafficked &lt;a href=&#34;http://reddit.com/r/india&#34;&gt;r/india&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;my state has 300+ engineering colleges and my parents decided that i am going to be an engineer. so, i wrote an exam and got into one institute (luckily i can make it into a good institute where there are campus interviews.. the luck being i might have gotten 2 multiple choice questions correct than an unfortunate guy who will be discarded by our society)&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Source: Friend of mine who is sadly ‘training’ at a big ‘IT company’ now (He wishes to remain anonymous, and I could see why)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Because everyone else did&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Because parents told&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Because it will be very sophisticated and relaxing there, with lots of recreational facilities&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I’m just going to leave this here, and hope that when this boom does bust, it doesn’t leave too many dead bodies in its wake.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;From the usually boring Yahoo answers, we have this &lt;a href=&#34;http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AsrKG62JfeU5scqqMv6mO0ojzKIX;_ylv=3?qid=20090208040536AAHBrYH&#34;&gt;gem of a question&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What is the best way to stop your child becoming an athiest?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I don’t want any of my children to be punished by God.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, it also had this gem of an answer:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Do not educate them, or expose them to critical thinking, logic or science.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Lie to them constantly about how the world works. Feed them a steady diet of mumbo jumbo dressed up like real knowledge – the jumbo jet in the whirlwind for example – and pretend that it is deep wisdom.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
