      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.susam.in/2011/05/infosys-tcs-or-wipro.html&#34;&gt;Succinctly written post that every engineering college student should read&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Ofcourse, someone should write a post called “CS, EC or EEE?” “Neither” for high school students, because for a lot of people the answer to the question “Should you do Engineering?” is a huge “No”.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The comments section is even more awesome. Choice quotes:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A sympathizer/astroturfer/cognitively dissonant person writes:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Are you saying that anybody who can browse the internet and knows about the computer can do our jobs? Don’t you think we would find that a bit insulting? It might be true in many cases where the proper training can make a monkey do our jobs, but isn’t that true for many fields? Aren’t monkeys being trained to pilot airships?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Very late one. I’ve been using this since last September (as those of you on twitter and following me would know).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It was on 2.1 for a long, long time – and even after 2.2 came out (first unofficially and then officially) I didn’t upgrade for almost a month (thanks to a missing usb cable and some laziness). I then upgraded to official 2.2, then one of the ‘Stock’ bootloaderless ROMs, and then to InDroid 3.0, then semi-bricked my phone (trying to install InDroid 4.0) and finally settled on Kyrillos.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
