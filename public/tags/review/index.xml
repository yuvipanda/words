      <description>Succinctly written post that every engineering college student should read.
Ofcourse, someone should write a post called &amp;#8220;CS, EC or EEE?&amp;#8221; &amp;#8220;Neither&amp;#8221; for high school students, because for a lot of people the answer to the question &amp;#8220;Should you do Engineering?&amp;#8221; is a huge &amp;#8220;No&amp;#8221;.
The comments section is even more awesome. Choice quotes:

      <description>Very late one. I&amp;#8217;ve been using this since last September (as those of you on twitter and following me would know).
It was on 2.1 for a long, long time &amp;#8211; and even after 2.2 came out (first unofficially and then officially) I didn&amp;#8217;t upgrade for almost a month (thanks to a missing usb cable and some laziness). I then upgraded to official 2.2, then one of the &amp;#8216;Stock&amp;#8217; bootloaderless ROMs, and then to InDroid 3.</description>
