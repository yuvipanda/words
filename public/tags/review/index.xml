      <description>Succinctly written post that every engineering college student should read.
Ofcourse, someone should write a post called “CS, EC or EEE?” “Neither” for high school students, because for a lot of people the answer to the question “Should you do Engineering?” is a huge “No”.
The comments section is even more awesome. Choice quotes:

      <description>Very late one. I’ve been using this since last September (as those of you on twitter and following me would know).
It was on 2.1 for a long, long time – and even after 2.2 came out (first unofficially and then officially) I didn’t upgrade for almost a month (thanks to a missing usb cable and some laziness). I then upgraded to official 2.2, then one of the ‘Stock’ bootloaderless ROMs, and then to InDroid 3.</description>
