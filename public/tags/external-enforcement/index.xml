      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve unfollowed everyone I follow on Twitter, and am slowly starting back up from scratch. I&amp;rsquo;m only going to follow people who are:
 Underrepresented people in Tech (as broadly construed) Journalists  And that&amp;rsquo;s it. I&amp;rsquo;ll follow back friends I&amp;rsquo;m not otherwise in contact with as well, but might take a while.
I&amp;rsquo;ve had this for a few days and am already enjoying using it far more than I did before.</description>
