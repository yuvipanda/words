      <description>In conversation with Nirbheek about my blog post on note taking, he said something like &amp;lsquo;my system of knowledge has holes, and I lose track of stuff I learnt because of that&amp;rsquo;.

However, a bookmarking system will help me consume and retain knowledge. Both need to be integrated, but I currently had only one half of the puzzle.</description>

      <description>I am trying to find a nice way to keep thoughts, ideas and notes outside my head for a few months now.

I&amp;rsquo;ll walk through the various applications I&amp;rsquo;ve tried, along with the criteria I&amp;rsquo;ve developed by the end</description>
