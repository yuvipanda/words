      <description>A while back, I moved my blog (from a wordpress install whose data I lost) to my own platform (HiSlain).
After several close calls, I&amp;#8217;m officially moving from HiSlain back to WordPress. I just don&amp;#8217;t have enough time to maintain all the things I wanted in a blog platform in HiSlain, hence the move back. However, it satisfied it&amp;#8217;s purpose &amp;#8211; I learnt to write code I could use, others could use, and others could contribute to.</description>
