      <title>Why working at “Big Co” is unsatisfying</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update:&lt;/strong&gt; As usual, &lt;a href=&#34;http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2636486&#34;&gt;good comments at HN&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I’ve been trying to put it in words for a while, and failing utterly every time. &lt;a href=&#34;http://swombat.com/&#34;&gt;swombat&lt;/a&gt; gets to the crux of it wonderfully:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;At the same time, something really bothered me about my work. &lt;strong&gt;It felt pointless.&lt;/strong&gt; One project I did (whose output was basically a PPT and Word document outlining the successes and failures of a client project), which took two and a half months, had, as its only apparent purpose, the promotion of the person who had led the project. Accenture was paid (quite well) so that I would sit there and produce a piece of paper that justified this person’s promotion.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>“Infosys, TCS or Wipro?” “None”</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.susam.in/2011/05/infosys-tcs-or-wipro.html&#34;&gt;Succinctly written post that every engineering college student should read&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Ofcourse, someone should write a post called “CS, EC or EEE?” “Neither” for high school students, because for a lot of people the answer to the question “Should you do Engineering?” is a huge “No”.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The comments section is even more awesome. Choice quotes:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A sympathizer/astroturfer/cognitively dissonant person writes:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Are you saying that anybody who can browse the internet and knows about the computer can do our jobs? Don’t you think we would find that a bit insulting? It might be true in many cases where the proper training can make a monkey do our jobs, but isn’t that true for many fields? Aren’t monkeys being trained to pilot airships?&lt;/p&gt;</description>
