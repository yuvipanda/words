      <description>Am migrating to per-day posts now. More granularity + I can fit more info in. The ultimate aim of the DevLog is to keep me on my toes and make sure I don&amp;#8217;t relapse into no-productivity hellholes. Daily DevLogs should do a better job at them.
 Spent some more time trying to get Kiwix to compile under OS X. Macports issue fixed, but more issues persist. It&amp;#8217;s one damn complicated build system :| Not to mention that OS X sucks balls.</description>

      <description>With me back to a place where I can be completely open about what code I am writing (yay!), I think it&amp;#8217;s time I restart my devlog :)
Last time, I was using my old blogging engine, and hand-wrote them in a markdown file on my netbook. Things have changed a lot since then, and this time I&amp;#8217;ll be directly writing/publishing them daily from WordPress
&amp;#8211;
Dec 4 I finally grokked Indexes in databases.</description>

      <description>May 25-June 13 Loads of things happened.
Finished/polished up ShortUrl. Pending review. Would go into not just tawiki, but possibly all wmf wikis. YAY!
Moved to a dual monitor setup. Dual 23&amp;#8243; Monitors, one Samsung LED and one Acer LCD. Also moved to 8G of RAM. VMs are much less painful now.
Did a few back/forths with the GSoC extension architecture. It&amp;#8217;s still blocking, so working with the non-blocking parts of GSoC now.</description>

Mar 20 &amp;#8211; 31 More contract work for more money.
My dump patch to meidawiki got commited, then blasted during Code Review. This is what I get for trusting other people&amp;#8217;s code blindly, especially after 5 years. Lesson learnt. Fixed all issues, and now waiting for a review before commit.</description>

      <description>I&amp;#8217;ve started keeping devlogs, recording everyday &amp;#8216;productive&amp;#8217; activity I do everyday. Publicly shaming myself into doing something productive every day. Just records for this month, next month on should provide time spent as well. There&amp;#8217;s an entry for every day when I&amp;#8217;ve touched a computer. I&amp;#8217;ll be continuously refining this format, so feedback welcome
