  <p><strong>Update:</strong> As usual, <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2636486">good comments at HN</a>.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve been trying to put it in words for a while, and failing utterly every time. <a href="http://swombat.com/">swombat</a> gets to the crux of it wonderfully:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>At the same time, something really bothered me about my work. <strong>It felt pointless.</strong> One project I did (whose output was basically a PPT and Word document outlining the successes and failures of a client project), which took two and a half months, had, as its only apparent purpose, the promotion of the person who had led the project. Accenture was paid (quite well) so that I would sit there and produce a piece of paper that justified this person&#8217;s promotion.</p>

<p>To me, that didn&#8217;t seem like a good use of the precious few years we have on this Earth. In fact, the feeling that I was wasting my time was really killing me inside (I&#8217;m not exaggerating).</p>

<p><em><a href="http://swombat.com/2011/6/7/accenture-before-startups">My life in Accenture before Startups</a></em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Indeed. I&#8217;d be surprised if anything in the Indian &#8220;Big Companies&#8221; are any different &#8211; perhaps worse (thoughts/experiences?).</p>

<p>There is a silver lining though:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>One of the most crucial things I learned in Accenture was <strong>how to hold back my habit of being blunt and direct with everyone</strong>. I learned to be smoother and far more effective. That&#8217;s a valuable thing to learn.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As <a href="http://vijaysharma.name">Vijay</a> would tell you, that&#8217;s something I&#8217;d definitely find useful &#8211; something that every geek would find useful (<a href="http://thingist.com/t/item/4372/">relevant link about geeks being assholes</a>, and <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2322696">excellent HN comments</a>). Perhaps <a href="http://yuvi.in/blog/infosys-tcs-or-wipro-none/" title="“Infosys, TCS or Wipro?” “None”">a stint at Infosys</a> would help me there? :D</p>

  <p><a href="http://blog.susam.in/2011/05/infosys-tcs-or-wipro.html">Succinctly written post that every engineering college student should read</a>.</p>

<p>Ofcourse, someone should write a post called &#8220;CS, EC or EEE?&#8221; &#8220;Neither&#8221; for high school students, because for a lot of people the answer to the question &#8220;Should you do Engineering?&#8221; is a huge &#8220;No&#8221;.</p>

<p>The comments section is even more awesome. Choice quotes:</p>

<p><em>A sympathizer/astroturfer/cognitively dissonant person writes:</em></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Are you saying that anybody who can browse the internet and knows about the computer can do our jobs? Don&#8217;t you think we would find that a bit insulting? It might be true in many cases where the proper training can make a monkey do our jobs, but isn&#8217;t that true for many fields? Aren&#8217;t monkeys being trained to pilot airships?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And is responded with multiple &#8216;yes&#8217;es. I was quite astounded, surprised, even enraged when I heard someone working there describe his job as &#8220;I do nothing, really. I&#8217;ve to press buttons and record answers in excel sheets. Rest of the time I can hit on the girls and do my own thing. Nobody cares. It&#8217;s more fun than college!&#8221;. Sigh.</p>

<p>Also, another point mentioned by someone anonymous:</p>

<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>Brand name: Students feel that Infosys, TCS, Wipro are great brand names. It is far from the truth. Infosys, TCS, Wipro are embarrassing brand names to write in your resume with the exception if you want to join another Infosys, TCS, Wipro like company or Cognizant, Accenture like companies who are ready to hire any crap that comes out of Infosys, TCS, Wipro. Good technical companies know that these brand names are like balloons. They look big from outside but has only gas inside. Actually an engineer from a good but less popular startup has more chance than a person from Infosys to get a call of interview from a big technical company.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>

<p>&#8220;Working at Infosys for 6 years!&#8221; only sounds awesome to maamis who want to buy you for their daughters.</p>

<p>Another typical attitude that boils the blood of anyone with a tiny bit of work ethic:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>hello all, what if someone(CS/IT engineer) is not interested in engineering and he wants to do mba from a very good college. But he needs time for preparation. So he make decision to join tcs/infosys/wipro (cause he didn&#8217;t get job other than these companies), only for job experience and he can get time for preparation of CAT/XAT/snap/cet etc.. Will it be a good decision??</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And of course, the actual &#8216;client&#8217; who gets shafted:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I am quite alarmed by Sam&#8217;s response, especially his 5th point where he writes that the Indian vendors send their employees to work on client&#8217;s site not because they are proficient in technology but because you need to factor in everyone&#8217;s needs and desiers. Excuse me! We need good technology people. Why can&#8217;t you guys just be professional and keep your personal lives and poverty away while discussing technology?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I highly recommend you guys go and read the entire blog post *and* the comments. Especially if you&#8217;re still in college. The placement cells at many colleges make it appear as if these are the ultimate companies ever, that you should fast and pray for 30 days to get a job there &#8211; but they have no other go. This, and their reviews at Glassdoor (<a href="http://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Infosys-Reviews-E7927.htm">Infosys</a>, <a href="http://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Employee-Review-Tata-Consultancy-Services-RVW394860.htm">TCS</a>, <a href="http://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Wipro-Reviews-E9936.htm">Wipro</a>, <a href="http://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/HCL-Technologies-Reviews-E9946.htm">HCL</a>)</p>

<p>I&#8217;m waiting for this boom to crash. And burn. Mass de-brainwashing is important for our future. This topic definitely needs a bigger rant from me someday.</p>

<p>Stolen Disclaimer:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>ALERT: If you are not interested in making a career in engineering, lack the confidence to do so, or you are very content with working for one of these three companies for reasons that are valid to you, you may stop reading this and go back to what you were doing before landing on this page.</p>
