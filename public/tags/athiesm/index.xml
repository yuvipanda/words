      <description>From the usually boring Yahoo answers, we have this gem of a question:
 What is the best way to stop your child becoming an athiest?
I don’t want any of my children to be punished by God.
 However, it also had this gem of an answer:
 Do not educate them, or expose them to critical thinking, logic or science.
Lie to them constantly about how the world works.</description>
