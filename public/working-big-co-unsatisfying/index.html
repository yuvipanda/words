      <p><strong>Update:</strong> As usual, <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2636486">good comments at HN</a>.</p>
<p>I’ve been trying to put it in words for a while, and failing utterly every time. <a href="http://swombat.com/">swombat</a> gets to the crux of it wonderfully:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>At the same time, something really bothered me about my work. <strong>It felt pointless.</strong> One project I did (whose output was basically a PPT and Word document outlining the successes and failures of a client project), which took two and a half months, had, as its only apparent purpose, the promotion of the person who had led the project. Accenture was paid (quite well) so that I would sit there and produce a piece of paper that justified this person’s promotion.</p>
<p>To me, that didn’t seem like a good use of the precious few years we have on this Earth. In fact, the feeling that I was wasting my time was really killing me inside (I’m not exaggerating).</p>
<p><em><a href="http://swombat.com/2011/6/7/accenture-before-startups">My life in Accenture before Startups</a></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Indeed. I’d be surprised if anything in the Indian “Big Companies” are any different – perhaps worse (thoughts/experiences?).</p>
<p>There is a silver lining though:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One of the most crucial things I learned in Accenture was <strong>how to hold back my habit of being blunt and direct with everyone</strong>. I learned to be smoother and far more effective. That’s a valuable thing to learn.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As <a href="http://vijaysharma.name">Vijay</a> would tell you, that’s something I’d definitely find useful – something that every geek would find useful (<a href="http://thingist.com/t/item/4372/">relevant link about geeks being assholes</a>, and <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2322696">excellent HN comments</a>). Perhaps <a href="http://yuvi.in/blog/infosys-tcs-or-wipro-none/" title="“Infosys, TCS or Wipro?” “None”">a stint at Infosys</a> would help me there? :D</p>
