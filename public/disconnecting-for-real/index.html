                    <p>I&rsquo;ve been on the Internet since I was 14. And I don&rsquo;t remember a time when I did not have a computer &#8211; I think I got mine when I was 10. Growing up, writing code has always been a major part of me &#8211; my identity. I&rsquo;ve never quite managed to separate &lsquo;me&rsquo; from &lsquo;my code&rsquo; &#8211; despite mouthing off the soundbite &lsquo;You are not your code!&rsquo; to plenty of people.</p>

<p>After Wikimania 2013, I spent a week in Hong Kong. The first few days were rough, but after that &#8211; it was amazing. For the first time I could imagine, I had completely managed to not think about code at all! I had my laptop locked in a locker somewhere, and didn&rsquo;t even bother getting to it. I didn&rsquo;t feel the burning urge to make a commit. The feeling of guilt that keeps gnawing at you from the back of the head &lsquo;teehee you have been so unproductive today!&rsquo;.</p>

<p>That was a rather great feeling. Put things into a little bit more perspective. A step towards separating my identity from my code. I gave up on my GitHub streaks after that. I&rsquo;ll probably also be less of a codeaholic.</p>

<p>I could write about &lsquo;oh my god, this was amazing!&rsquo; and detail where I travelled in Hong Kong, but I think what was far more fascinating was <em>how</em>. I did not feel in a hurry. Did not feel like having to &lsquo;tick all boxes&rsquo; before leaving. Just&#8230; actually relaxing. And doing whatever.</p>

<p>Vacations are good :)</p>
