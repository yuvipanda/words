 Have started taking weekends slightly more seriously. My brain feels less overwhelmed after that. Should take weekends even more seriously going forward. Merged labsdb-auditor rewrite patch. Code clean enough for my tastes now, although not documented enough. Lots of back and forth CR with valhallasw was really nice &#8211; it&#8217;s something I&#8217;ve been missing for the past few months." />

  <p>Woohoo, 2015! :) Let&#8217;s see if I can keep this going this time :)</p>

<ul>
<li>Have started taking weekends slightly more seriously. My brain feels less overwhelmed after that. Should take weekends even more seriously going forward.</li>
<li>Merged <code>labsdb-auditor</code> <a href="https://gerrit.wikimedia.org/r/#/c/182164/">rewrite patch</a>. Code clean enough for my tastes now, although not documented enough. Lots of back and forth CR with valhallasw was really nice &#8211; it&#8217;s something I&#8217;ve been missing for the past few months. Debating over style and cleanliness was also interesting. Felt like I had been taking code cleanliness and proper design not as seriously as I should have, and this is now time to change that. Also spent time consciously thinking about the commit message I was writing, and shall continue doing that. I think I&#8217;ve taken a few things for granted wrt code quality and design, and should be more careful. And learnt a few more tricks about decorators (haven&#8217;t built decorators that are parameterized before).</li>
<li>Read a few chapters of <a href="http://book.realworldhaskell.org/">Real World Haskell</a>. Quite nice, although the syntax feels a bit too dense for my tastes. Still should maybe write things with <a href="http://www.call-cc.org/">ChickenScheme</a> instead :)</li>
<li>Continuing re-reading Coders at Work, which continues to be a thought provoking, wonderful book.</li>
</ul>
