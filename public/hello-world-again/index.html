You can still possibly checkout the <a href="http://blog.yuvisense.net">old blog</a> – if I manage to get the content back :)</p>

<h4 id="the-statbot">The Statbot</h4>
<p><a href="http://thestatbot.com">TheStatBot.com</a> is being retired.</p>
<p>I don’t have enough time on my hands to maintain that seperately. I originally wanted to develop StatBot as a brand of it’s own, but I now have no time on my hands to do so. I have an internship coming up (more details later), have another one slated to start in 3 months, and hell just turned down one more! And ofcourse, there is <a href="http://busroutes.in">busroutes.in</a>, <a href="http://novelrace.in">novelrace.in</a>, and a bunch of other community sites I’m involved in, along with <a href="http://github.com/yuvipanda">my open source projects</a>.</p>
<p>And ofcourse, I have college life to attend to – and believe me, I’m having tons of fun. Yes, I do have a social life – I never thought I’ll have one till I joined this particular college. I hope to leave the college in a better state than when I entered it, and so am taking an active interest in developing it. And the management is awesome enough to let me help. So that takes up my time too!</p>
<p>I can honestly claim to not have the time to maintain the statbot brand :(</p>
<p>However, doesn’t mean I’m going to stop doing stats! I &lt;3 stats – I’ve just got a book from my (awesome) college library so I could start learning ‘proper’ statistics instead of just drawing graphs and looking for co-relations. And ofcourse, the code I use for stats (<a href="http://github.com/yuvipanda/goodfather">goodfather</a>, named after my awesome friend <a href="http://lagesse.org">Rob</a>) is also being actively developed, and is in it’s sixth (and possibly last) rewrite (maybe another blog post some other day about the number of rewrites).</p>
<p>Expect more stats posts. They’ll be on this blog too! I promise!</p>
<h4 id="blog-platform">Blog Platform</h4>
<p>This blog <em>runs</em> on <a href="http://github.com/yuvipanda/hislain">code</a> I personally wrote. The first piece of code that I’m using in a ‘production’ environment. I’m pumped! There will be bugs, and I will kill them. One.By.One :)</p>
<p>Okay, back to work now. More blog posts hopefully coming soon!</p>
