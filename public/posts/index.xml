      <description>Submitting &amp;lsquo;non-interactive&amp;rsquo; jobs that can run independent of a user&amp;rsquo;s current session on a JupyterHub is a pressing problem. There are many many solutions to this, but I think there&amp;rsquo;s a lot of value in having an extremely simple solution that solves exactly one extremely well defined problem.
We will only consider JupyterHubs running on top of Kubernetes, since that has all the actual capabilities we need to solve this problem.</description>
