I ran into this very interesting video from Senthil‘s facebook feed. The part that I found most interesting was the sense of entitlement – that despite not knowing anything about what they are going to be hired for (aka Programming), and admitting it to everyone, they still expect to be given jobs when they want.
While this would make sense in someplace like the military, where you go in and then train, it makes no sense for graduates of an engineering program, where they spent 4 years of their life training." /><meta name="keywords" content="yuvi, yuvipanda" />

<p>While this would make sense in someplace like the military, where you go in and then train, it makes no sense for graduates of an engineering program, where they spent 4 years of their life training. They claim that t<span style="line-height: 13px;">hey spent four years studying programming but can not pass a simple written programming test, and do not want to even attempt writing it.</span></p>
<p>I don’t understand engineering students, and I’ve been surrounded by them for the last 5 years.</p>
