<p><em>I&#8217;ve started keeping devlogs, recording productive activity every day in an attempt to publicly shame myself into doing productive things. This is the delayed march edition</em></p>

<h3 id="mar-20-8211-31">Mar 20 &#8211; 31</h3>

<p>More contract work for more money.</p>

<p>My dump patch to meidawiki got commited, then blasted during Code Review. This is what I get for trusting other people&#8217;s code blindly, especially after 5 years. Lesson learnt. Fixed all issues, and now waiting for a review before commit.</p>

<p>More help for Madhu&#8217;s GSoC, on and off. Same for Arun and Karthik.</p>

<p>Decide to give up on dumps (no concrete work found) and pick up wikipedia offline, after post to wikitech-l by the offline guy saying he is looking for people.</p>

<p>Channels #mediawiki and #wikimedia-tech are quite fun, actually. Not bad at all.</p>

<p>Started writing php code. Not that ugh, actually.</p>

<p>Spent 3 days at In50Hrs. Prototyped the CollegeReviews thing I was always dreaming about. Concepts were fleshed out really well. Need to spend more time on this thing.</p>

<h3 id="mar-15-8211-20">Mar 15 &#8211; 20</h3>

<p>Almost got fix to Mediawiki that made dumps 5% faster. Now just need to prove it on a larger scale before it gets accepted.</p>

<p>Did contracting work for some decent money. Feels pretty good.</p>

<p>Started helping madhu with her gsoc. She&#8217;s darn smart.</p>

<h3 id="mar-14">Mar 14</h3>

<p>Did bits of resume.</p>

<h3 id="mar-1-13">Mar 1-13</h3>

<p>Some amount of Mediawiki work &#8211; getting it to run, learning how to profile it, profiling the import and export process. Identified a hotspot in the export process (UtfNormal), need to try to get a fix in.</p>

<p>Moved main system from Ubuntu 32 bit to Debian 64 bit. Yay. Tried to jhbuild gnome-shell and failed miserably. Boo.</p>

<p>Started helping other folks with their GSoC. Yay.</p>
