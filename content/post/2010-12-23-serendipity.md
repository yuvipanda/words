I&#8217;m back at home after travelling almost ten days &#8211; ACM ICPC at Coimbatore, One day at Ooty, the last [FOSS.in][1] at Bangalore, [Nonameconf][2] at Bangalore, and finally chilling out losing at XBox 360 Takken at the \[Zynga\]\[z\] office. 

One thing I&#8217;ve realized sharply is that &#8220;Life will take you to interesting places and make you do interesting things, **if only you let it**&#8220;

I realized that my days were being pretty much the same all day. I&#8217;ve shook up a lot of things &#8211; quit many &#8216;safe&#8217; stuff I was doing so I could go try stupid, freaky things &#8211; I don&#8217;t know what. Should be fun and interesting.

What stupid, crazy, freaky and _incredibly_ interesting things you have done?
