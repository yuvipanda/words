Woohoo, 2015! :) Let&#8217;s see if I can keep this going this time :)

  * Have started taking weekends slightly more seriously. My brain feels less overwhelmed after that. Should take weekends even more seriously going forward.
  * Merged `labsdb-auditor` [rewrite patch][1]. Code clean enough for my tastes now, although not documented enough. Lots of back and forth CR with valhallasw was really nice &#8211; it&#8217;s something I&#8217;ve been missing for the past few months. Debating over style and cleanliness was also interesting. Felt like I had been taking code cleanliness and proper design not as seriously as I should have, and this is now time to change that. Also spent time consciously thinking about the commit message I was writing, and shall continue doing that. I think I&#8217;ve taken a few things for granted wrt code quality and design, and should be more careful. And learnt a few more tricks about decorators (haven&#8217;t built decorators that are parameterized before). 
  * Read a few chapters of [Real World Haskell][2]. Quite nice, although the syntax feels a bit too dense for my tastes. Still should maybe write things with [ChickenScheme][3] instead :)
  * Continuing re-reading Coders at Work, which continues to be a thought provoking, wonderful book.
