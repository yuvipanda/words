Should have done this a while back. Added a [CC BY][1] mark to the blog. Will add a notice to the front page as well, stating that all media I produce (when not bound to someone else&#8217;s copyright) is CC BY. I think code is already taken care of, but I&#8217;ll add a note here saying that all code I release (unless explicitly licensed otherwise) is CC0 Licensed.

Now to actually produce something of value&#8230;

(Thanks to [Ironholds][2] for [the push][3])
