I ran into this thought provoking though when randomly attempting to relax this weekend. There's a summary at [LWN](https://lwn.net/Articles/712376/) if you do not want to watch the talk - but as the lwn summarizer admits, the video definitely conveys things that are hard to capture on text.

The core takeaway for me is to think about:

> what is the future of free and open-source software? The answer was: it has no future. 

This seems somehow connected to 'democratizing programming', which I had earlier given a [talk about](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEyqVXzCJJc). Somehow, it feels like there needs to be an update / rebirth of the [GNU Freedoms](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html) for the world we live in.
