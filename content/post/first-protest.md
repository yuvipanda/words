I went to the protests at SFO last weekend. It was the first real set of protests I've been to.

I was there for about 10h on day 1, and came home exhausted. I went back on Day 2, and this time stayed for much shorter period of time (~4h?) before heading back home.

I woke up that saturday feeling very depressed, angry, and helpless. By sunday night, I was only depressed and angry - but not helpless. The number and variety of people at the protests was very heartwarming, and made me feel distinctly not alone. Before going I was not sure what going to a protest accomplishes. I still do not know - but I know it gave me hope. Maybe that is good enough?

Everyone who was at the protest even if it does not directly affect you yet - thank you!

I promise I'll continue doing all I can, even and especially when it is about things that do not affect me yet.
