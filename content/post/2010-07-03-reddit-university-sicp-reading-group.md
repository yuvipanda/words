I&#8217;ve joined [Reddit University][1]&#8216;s [SICP Reading Group][2] class. I&#8217;ve wanted to read through [SICP][3] for a long time, and have gotten started many times &#8211; never completed it. Maybe the group effects will help me finish this time :)

If you&#8217;re interested in expanding your horizons beyond mere code-monkey programming, [join up!][2]
