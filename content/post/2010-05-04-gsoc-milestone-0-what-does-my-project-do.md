_I&#8217;m using a [RTM List][1] to track my milestones for this [my GSoC][2] this year. I&#8217;ll be making a blog post for each item ticked off that list, to share what I&#8217;ve learnt in my journey from n00b to someone whose code is good enough to be included in GNOME. This is part 0 in the series, where I tell you what my project is all about and how [Cheese][3] is going to become awesomer._

So, what exactly does [my proposal][4] mean for Cheese?

  1. Moving the UI to [Vala][5] (from C)
  2. Move display bits from [GTK+][6] to [clutter][7]
  3. Implement Live Preview to show people how applying an effect will look before applying it
  4. Implement loadable effects so you aren&#8217;t stuck with just 12 preloaded effects.

I&#8217;m told that the scope is kinda too big for 3 months &#8211; but I&#8217;m sure that with careful planning (hah!), around 40 hours of work a week (haha!), lots of time away from college (hahaha!) I can do this stuff :)

I&#8217;m keeping my code in a [github repo][8], so watch that for code updates. And will be updating this blog at the completion of every milestone, so subscribe if you haven&#8217;t :)

**Note**: My exams are still going on. Won&#8217;t be coding much till they end (May 19th).
