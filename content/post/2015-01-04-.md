I&#8217;m not particularly sure, to be honest. It all feels a bit of a blur at the moment &#8211; it went by really fast, and really intense, mostly.

  * (Redacted). So much Redacted. You&#8217;ve no idea.
  * Finished up the Wikipedia Android app to a point where I feel happy leaving it in other people&#8217;s hands :) Closure after the horrible PhoneGap Wikipedia App fiasco :)
  * Moved to the ops team. TBH I never thought I&#8217;d be good enough, but apparently I am :)
  * Wrote [Quarry][1], which a lot of people seem to like :)
