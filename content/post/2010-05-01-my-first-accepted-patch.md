As part of my [GSoC][1] preparations, I wrote a few patches for [Cheese][2]. [One of them][3] (a one liner to fix a crash) has made it to [GNOME 2.30.1][4] &#8211; the other two ([1][5] and [2][6]) are slightly more significant and involve UI changes, and so will be integrated later.

Free beer to everyone who can catch me in a bar! Free Pepsi/Sprite/Egg Puff to anyone who can catch me in the College Stores ;)

P.S. Obligatory thanks to [_ke][7] and [fargiolas][8] for guiding me through the difficult bits :)
