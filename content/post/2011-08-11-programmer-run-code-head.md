From [HN][1]:

_(emphasis mine)_

I believe that if you have made that _cognitive leap_, you can call yourself a programmer. It means you&#8217;ve entered into the [second hump][2] &#8211; you are a programmer. One of us. Welcome :)

This is also the reason why solving programming challenges at places like [InterviewStreet Challenges][3], [CodeChef][4], [TopCoder][5], [SPOJ][6], etc also increase your general programming skills &#8211; they require that you continuously run code in the interpreter in your head. Helps you train your [procedural memory][7]. Same reason why learning different language paradigms (OOP, Purely Functional, Procedural, etc) makes you a better programmer.

Reminds me that I have four more chapters in SICP to finish and Clojure to learn :)
