Am migrating to per-day posts now. More granularity + I can fit more info in. The ultimate aim of the DevLog is to keep me on my toes and make sure I don&#8217;t relapse into no-productivity hellholes. Daily DevLogs should do a better job at them.

  * Spent some more time trying to get Kiwix to compile under OS X. Macports issue fixed, but more issues persist. It&#8217;s one damn complicated build system :| Not to mention that OS X sucks balls. Still no luck.
  * Moved my extension from GPoC to SelectionSifter, as picked by Sumanah (and remembered by Siebrand)
  * Added more content to my &#8216;[How to become a mediawiki hacker][1]&#8216; page. Outline in shape, needs content. ([This][2] is the page I am rewriting)
  * Cleaned up my Mediawiki.org [userpage][3]. Added stuff I&#8217;m working on there. Archived lots of older pages.
  * Published [livetrains][4] to GitHub. As expected Kishore cleaned it up a bit. Have figured out how to do the time modelling (Thanks lifeeth!). Should finish up when I get time

Need.To.Be.More.Productive!
