Keeping a running list of things I want to learn! 

* How to use org mode properly? Should I use it for notes over markdown?
* How do linux network namespaces work?
* How to run GUI apps with systemd?
* What exactly is a 'tty'?
* How does HTTP2 actually work?
* How do X509 / TLS certificates work?
* How to use cgroups directly?
* Can I just use emacs terminals for all my terminal needs?

If you know of resources that'll help me learn these things, do let me know!
