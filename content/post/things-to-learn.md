Keeping a running list of things I want to learn! 

There's also a list of [things I want to build](http://words.yuvi.in/post/things-to-learn/).

* How to use org mode properly? Should I use it for notes over markdown?
* Develop a deep understanding of how networks work.
* How do linux network namespaces work?
* How to run GUI apps with systemd?
  * I did learn! Both a [hacky version](http://words.yuvi.in/post/systemd-gui-applications/) and a [much better version](http://words.yuvi.in/post/systemd-simple-containment/) that also taught me some Go!
* What exactly is a 'tty'?
* How does HTTP2 actually work?
* How do X509 / TLS certificates work?
* How to use cgroups directly?
* Can I just use emacs terminals for all my terminal needs?
* How does NFS work, and why is it so crappy?
* How does ssh work?
* How does mosh work?
* How do contact lenses work? HOW DO LENSES WORK?
* Can I simply run a local DNS recursor on my laptop for performance & blocking me from visiting the orange website?

If you know of resources that'll help me learn these things, do let me know!
