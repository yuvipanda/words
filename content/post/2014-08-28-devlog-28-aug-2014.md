Let&#8217;s see. I&#8217;m also going to attempt to include patch links wherever possible.

  * Cleaned up `session` handling bugs in Quarry. They were previously not closing properly, causing SQLAlchemy exceptions now and then that&#8217;ll let queries die in a &#8216;queued&#8217; state. This should _hopefully_ be fixed by https://gerrit.wikimedia.org/r/#/c/156909/.
  * Made https://graphite.wmflabs.org somewhat more stable again for use by Wikimedia BetaLabs folks by just blacklisting all other projects from sending data to it (with a local whitelist hack + https://gerrit.wikimedia.org/r/#/c/156966/). This would let them use it, and they said they would find it massively useful. All this is a hack until https://rt.wikimedia.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=8163 could be resolved and I can deploy graphite on a &#8216;real&#8217; machine. 
  * Minor patch to my Gerrit -> IRC bot to make it strip a common prefix (&#8216;operations/&#8217;) from change messages posted to the operations channel &#8211; https://gerrit.wikimedia.org/r/#/c/156877/. Also made one that calls jenkins-bot jerkins-bot if it -1&#8217;s your patch (https://gerrit.wikimedia.org/r/#/c/156878/) but it seems to have a bug that I can&#8217;t be bothered to debug atm.

Might spend some more time with Hive over the next few days &#8211; figured out an approach for using it from Python, and it should be fun to do so!
