This week on Cheese&#8230;.

WE MADE A RELEASE! :)

<http://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/sources/cheese/2.31/>

Cheese 2.31.1 is out. It&#8217;s a dev release. Does not have zarro boogs.
                  
But it is a release!

This week, we

  1. Fixed several perf bugs.
  2. Fixed some weird preferences dialog bugs
  3. Filed (and eventually had fixed) a bug in GStreamer.
  4. Fixed a regression
  5. Beautified the UI a bit (text name overlay of effects, etc)
  6. Assorted administrative work to prepare for release (Copyright
                  
    updating, merging back into master, etc)

I also passed my mid terms :)

Next week&#8230;

  1. Remove dependency on Mx Toolkit (it is not a blessed dependency,
                  
    and i&#8217;m not using large parts of it anyway)
  2. Performance improvements, especially at startup time. It is taking
                  
    _waaay_ too long .
  3. Fix problems in video mode.
  4. Make the TODO list shorter.
