You increase the time from 1.5 hours to 3 hours and give them another chance, of course!

What wonderful concern for the future of our country/humanity. I also wonder if there is such a test for College Lecturers, and how the pass percentage for that would be.

**Update:Â **Teachers now protesting against &#8216;difficulty&#8217; of test, [asking for &#8220;Grace Marks&#8221;][2]. Oh well.
