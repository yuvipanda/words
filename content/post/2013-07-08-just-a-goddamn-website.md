I&#8217;ve been trying to contribute more to the English Wikipedia, and of course, &#8216;fighting vandalism!&#8217; is something that is fairly easy to do &#8211; fight the **bad guys** from spreading misinformation! Even better, there exist many tools that make this super easy &#8211; [Stiki][1] and [Huggle][2] being popular ones. So I picked up STiki, and was on my merry way reverting vandals and marking edits as valid as I went along, trying to be careful to not err to much on either side. Most of them were simple enough, and the more complex ones I couldn&#8217;t decide on I let them pass. Easy enough. 

Some were too easy &#8211; such as reverting someone who &#8216;blank&#8217;ed a page. I reverted [one][3] without any thought, and left an [automated warning message][4], and went on my way. A little bit of time later, the same page was blanked by the same user again, and I reverted them again, without reading the content too closely.
