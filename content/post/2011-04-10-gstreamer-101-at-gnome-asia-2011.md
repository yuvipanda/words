My `GStreamer 101` presentation at [GNOME.asia][1] was _very_ wel received. I was quite happy with the way it turned out. Thanks to [Ford_Prefect][2] and [Bharath Acharya][3] for pulling me in :)

My very minimal slides are [here][4]. You can reuse them if you want to. 

Sadly, missed the week long hackfest :( Next time!
