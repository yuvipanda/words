&#8220;Write once, attempt to debug everywhere&#8221; is probably way more accurate than &#8220;Write once, run anywhere&#8221; &#8211; at least for GUI apps. There&#8217;s something rather special about ideas that are theoretically amazingly wonderful yet end up being a major pain in the butt when you try to put them in practice, isn&#8217;t it?

The older [Wikipedia App][1] happened to be in [PhoneGap][2], and I consider it one of my biggest blunders to not have torn it down on day 0 and rewritten it in something saner. I once started writing a blog post for the [Wikimedia Blog][3] about why we switched from PhoneGap to native apps, but it was killed for having too much profanity in it :) Someday, perhaps.
