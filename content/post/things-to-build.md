This is a running list of things I want to build!

There's an analogous running list of [things I want to learn](http://words.yuvi.in/post/things-to-learn/). Things move between them :) I also have higher standards of documentation (other people should be able to use it) before marking these as complete.

* **kubernetes-login**
  A helper to openssh that allows users to log in to a configurable user pod
  running on a kubernetes cluster. Should ideally support scp / sftp too.
  Helps get rid of SPOF login nodes
  
* **just-enough-containment**
  A purely for-learning docker-ish container project written purely in python.
  Written for pedagogy and personal understanding rather than production use.
