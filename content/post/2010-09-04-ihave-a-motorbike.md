So, I now have a motorbike!

It&#8217;s a [Bajaj Platina][1], and bought off GSoC money from my cousin [Sudar][2]. I&#8217;ve been learning to ride for a while, and it&#8217;s been good. Had my first accident a while back, and started riding again a few days back. 

I&#8217;m still very conscious about riding. I still think before clutching, braking, changing gears, etc. It hasn&#8217;t been internalized in the same way typing on a Keyboard has been &#8211; with enough practice (and accidents!) I guess I&#8217;ll be able to just &#8216;think&#8217; _left_ and make my bike go left. Focus is also a major issue right now &#8211; I&#8217;ve to consciously keep reminding myself to check for everything on the road &#8211; it doesn&#8217;t quite come automatically yet. Enough time should fix this too.

So far I&#8217;ve logged about 12 km on the bike &#8211; and should be doing more pretty soon. The Platina is no performance bike &#8211; but it will solve my major problem of walking the last mile when using public transport. Will try posting more up-to-date &#8216;bike logs&#8217; whenever I make significant trips.

Will post pictures when I have a decent camera &#8211; which should also be not far off.

**Note**: Real Bikers &#8211; don&#8217;t sneer. I&#8217;m just a noob :)
