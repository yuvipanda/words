Nothing much going on&#8230;

  * Continue reading Real World Haskell. This is indeed expanding my horizons, but I haven&#8217;t found any project I could use haskell in yet. Will keep looking.
  * Helped fix a parsoid outage yesterday. No biggie. I still do not understand fully how parsoid works / how it is set up, should do.
  * Spend most of the rest of the time in &#8216;weekend mode&#8217;, which includes mostly not doing things. That went mostly well.
  * Watched &#8216;Pink Floyd The Wall&#8217; movie. HOLY FUCK MY MIND IT IS GONE OMG IT IS QUITE REALLY NICE. Recommended.

I should probably write a &#8216;Year in Review 2014&#8217; post, but so much of that is going to be NSFW and private that there probably is no point&#8230; ;)
