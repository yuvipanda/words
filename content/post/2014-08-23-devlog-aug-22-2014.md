Was in Edinburgh again, missed writing it as I went along. Oh well.

  * Ported the code for the Wikipedia Android app automated builds to Python, and you can see it in action at http://tools.wmflabs.org/wikipedia-android-builds/ now. It lets you download the latest build, and notes the last successful build time. Good enough :) It was originally in bash, and porting it to python allowed me to create a &#8216;fake&#8217; API (just JSON blobs written to known locations in the file system). Next step is to write a helper app
  * The Atom experiment is coming along well. Am using it for most of my Puppet work these days. Should give LightTable another go as well.

That&#8217;s it!
