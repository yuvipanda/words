When I &#8216;took a year off&#8217; from college last year, I was supposed to be with [InterviewStreet][1] for at least a year.

Yet in November, I had quit. What happened?

A startup requires 100% of your attention &#8211; it has to be the [top][2] idea in your mind at all times. If not, that hurts both you and the startup. After 4 months, I realized that InterviewStreet as an idea was not something that will excite me enough to be the top idea in my head at all times.  Nothing wrong with the idea as such &#8211; just not something that excited me. I can not give 100% for something that I do not fully believe in.

Was it fun? Totally! Would I do it again? In a heartbeat.

It also helped me figure out a way to filter significant work I could actually do:

> Would you still be doing this if there was no money involved?

Because if the answer to that is &#8216;No&#8217;, you are working &#8216;just for the money&#8217; &#8211; a situation I&#8217;d rather not find myself in.
