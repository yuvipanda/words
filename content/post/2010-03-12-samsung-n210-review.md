I bought a brand new Samsung N210 Netbook about two weeks back &#8211; and have been using it almost non-stop since. I&#8217;ve been taking it to college every day, using it at every oportunity I get &#8211; on the college bus, on MTC buses, on the train, while waiting for the train, hell even _during_ a rather very boring class!

### The Great

  * The Screen! The **matte** screen is totally awesome. Viewable under all conditions &#8211; full on sunlight during a train commute or at a weird angle snuggled under the desk during class. It is sharp, and IMO has enough resolution (1024&#215;600). The bezel is small and not very distracting.
  * The Keyboard. 94% of a full size keyboard, I&#8217;m told. It is extremely comfortable, and I don&#8217;t miss too many keys. I do find the right shift absolutely useless though. The chicklet keys look great too
  * The Looks. One guy asked me if I was carrying a white MacBook. 

### The Good

  * The Touchpad. It is large and the mouse buttons are not bad. I don&#8217;t know if it supports two button finger scroll on Linux &#8211; but it does work on Windows. My hands do accidentally touch it often while typing, moving my cursor unexpectedly &#8211; but I have been able to stop that by using my right thumb for space instead of my left.
  * The Battery. I seem to get around 8 hours of usage under varying circumstances and conditions &#8211; while nothing to laugh at, I was expecting more. Might be because I haven&#8217;t been able to figure out a way to turn off the wifi chip from Linux.

### The Bad

  * The Heat. The fan isn&#8217;t very noisy, but the heat buildup is appreciable. I can&#8217;t really work with it directly on my lap.
  * The inbuilt webcam. 0.3 Megapixels. Bleh!
  * WiFi. Drops _very_ often, and not very sensitive. Ubuntu Autodetected it though.
  * The SD Card Slot. It has a cover that comes right off, and I guarentee I&#8217;ll lose it in a while.
  * Many of the Function Key functions aren&#8217;t supported on Linux. Was able to make the Brightness keys work after a hack though.

### The Awful

  * The ugly black sticker ad for _&#8220;Phoenix Hyperspace(tm) Instant-on&#8221;_. Ewww! Atleast there is only one big sticker spoiling this white beauty

Was it worth the 20k bucks I paid for it? I&#8217;m typing out this blog post while waiting at my Doctor&#8217;s, so I&#8217;d say it _is_ well worth the 20k bucks paid :)
