I&#8217;ve gotten rid of my Vim repo from GitHub, and switched to using [Vundle][1] + DropBox to keep my vim environment safely backed up.

You can find my [.vimrc][2] file here. With just this and Vundle setup, I find it much easier to port my settings elsewhere instead of using git.

Hat tip to [tecoholic][3] for pushing me to switch to Vundle :)
