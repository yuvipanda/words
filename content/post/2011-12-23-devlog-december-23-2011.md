Worked the day first from Domlur bus terminus, and then from Exotel&#8217;s office (with @vijaysw).

  * Incorporated search results (rather than just suggestions) into the Wikipedia app. Was a slight bitch to get right, but after that have made a bunch of variants that the others are testing out to see which one feels good (Suggestion if exists, else search, or search alone). Took up most of my time.
  * We put out a dud as RC3 for the Wikipedia app. A missing defaults statement. Lesson learnt: Test the entire process (uninstall -> install -> run -> test) before passing off RCs
  * HyperJuice battery has arrived. Commence working out of random public places.
