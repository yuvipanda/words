I&#8217;m going to participate in [Hackfest][1] at IITM&#8217;s Shaastra, starting tomorrow. Will hopefully be a lot of fun &#8211; and may I be able to contribute my first ever patch during the event ;) Got permission to not get back home &#8211; but wondering, where would I stay? Probably pass out in front of the computers :)

I&#8217;ll be hackin on GNOME Apps &#8211; hopefully [Banshee][2] (since that&#8217;s one app I **love**), or write a newish, smallish app with PyGTK. Anything would do but :)

Will be blogging more &#8211; Sadly, no camera, so no pictures :(

Anyone else coming along?
