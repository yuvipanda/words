I&#8217;ve been mostly off Twitter for a while now, interacting with it rarely, and only on my Phone. While I&#8217;ve had a vague feeling of uneasiness ever since they unveiled their now [_business friendly_ developer policies][1], it really hit home when my favorite Android twitter app, Falcon Pro, hit [Twitter&#8217;s arbitrary user token limit][2]Â (and Twitter declined to care). That, plus the Google Reader saga have jolted me out of complacency a bit.

It may be cliche, but &#8220;If you are not paying for it, you are the product&#8221; rings rather true at the moment.

So I&#8217;ll mostly be off Twitter (and Facebook too) now. Identi.ca seems inactive, but I will probably give it a shot too. I&#8217;m going to pick up the slack by actually blogging instead. Twitter seems to have completely killed my long form text writing ability. My Nexus 7 and bluetooth keyboard will hopefully help bring it back! Twitter is still good for publicity, so I&#8217;ll need to find a way to feed my blog links into Twitter.
