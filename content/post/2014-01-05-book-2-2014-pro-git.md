[Pro Git][1] is a nice book I recommend to newbies &#8211; yet I hadn&#8217;t fully read it once. I decided to do so, and I think it was reasonably useful. Most of the stuff in here I already knew, and the treatment of the stuff I did not (Git Internals, mostly) wasn&#8217;t deep enough to be useful. Nevertheless, reinforced some useful concepts in my head and probably gave me enough strong foundations for when I decide to dive into the actual internals of git more (probably by reading the source code?). Also looked very newbie friendly, so I&#8217;ll continue recommending this to people who want to learn about Git.
