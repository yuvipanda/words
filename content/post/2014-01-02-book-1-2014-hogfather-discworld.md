I&#8217;ve been reading a lot over the last few months ([Discworld][1] + Foundation gives me about 24 books in the last 3 months), and figured I&#8217;d extend that for the next year with a little more underlying planning. So [along][2] with Bala, Arun & Surya, I&#8217;ll try to read a hundred books this year, and also do a blog post each about them.

[Hogfather][3] is the 21st book in the Discworld series I&#8217;ve read. Rather wonderful commentary on rampant consumerization of&#8230; everything, incredibly well placed (and funny!) [ELIZA][4] references and an undercurrent of &#8216;importance of belief&#8217;. The God of Hangovers was a nice touch.

4/5.
