Talking to [Ankur Sethi](https://ankursethi.in/) made me think more clearly about **why** I want [note-taking](http://words.yuvi.in/post/note-taking-part-i/), [bookmarking setups](http://words.yuvi.in/post/note-taking-ii-bookmarks/).

I am **trying to stop feeling so overwhelmed by moving things out of my puny brain**.

The solution to this is two fold.
1. Commit to and do fewer things. Already working on this.
2. Be more efficient in the things you are doing.

A few years ago I gave up on chasing efficiency gains because they were all
so marginal (hello, maintaining a super customized `.vimrc`). But I think I
threw out the baby with the bathwater there, by focusing on the wrong kinds
of efficiency. So am trying again!
