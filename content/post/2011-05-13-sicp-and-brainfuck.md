No, I&#8217;m _not_ going to blow your mind by telling you I&#8217;m going to do the SICP exercises in BrainFuck :) 

I just wrote [my first brainfuck program][1]. Might as well be my last, but not sure. Tape-based turing-ish programing seems fun, so maybe I&#8217;ll try that again with something more expressive than brainfuck (or maybe that is pointless?)

And I&#8217;m doing the SICP Exercises. In [MIT-Scheme][2]. I&#8217;ve put them [up on GitHub][3]. I&#8217;m doing this with the [FPUG-C][4] SICP Study Group, so hope I&#8217;m able to complete it all this time :) Big props to [Balaji][5] for organizing it, and letting us get away with the free coke and coffee!
