Clearly I missed an entire week. I need to build a better system to make this easier&#8230;

Random notes.

  * Kicked out NFS from the Tool Labs proxies (with [1][1]). Yay! This hopefully explains the lockup of tools-proxy-01 yesterday night, maybe? It&#8217;s been restarted since, and I hope to no longer have instances randomly locoking on me. Infrastructure standards of 2009, here we come! :D I&#8217;ve also removed NFS from tools-redis, and migrated them to Jessie as well.
  * Fixed up all the races in how kubernetes workers are setup with [2][2]
  * Another instance is &#8216;stuck&#8217; again. Sigh. AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA. Paravoid helped debug this, tracking it down to NFS client issues in the 4.2 kernel (See [phab][3]). I moved k8s nodes back to a working 3.19 kernel (after filing [issue][4] about the other 3.19 kernel package I tried that didn&#8217;t work). 
  * Moved the tools proxies to 4.2 (lol?) after finding out huge ksoftirqd spikes in them. Let&#8217;s see if that improves things
  * I split up the individual components of PAWS, and have a working [nbserve][5] in there now! Exciting times. Need to fixup nbserve to use traitlets for config
  * Big Tool Labs outage (again!). Some tool accidentally sent about 12million job requests and crashed gridengine&#8217;s underlying backing store ([BerkeleyDB][6]). Reset to a clean slate after many hours (Thanks Coren!) and mostly things are back up now. I&#8217;m reading through the Berkeley DB [reference manual][7] now.
  * Persistance failed for ores&#8217;s redises again, mostly because `vm_overcommit` was turned off. Fixed in the core redis module so it does not happen again.
