I mentioned this in passing in my [earlier post][1], and was tweeting about it quite furiously &#8211; I&#8217;ve been selected to work on [Cheese][1] for this year&#8217;s [Google Summer of Code][2] :D 

[Link to my, uhm, _cheesy_ proposal][3]

### What Now?

Getting accepted doesn&#8217;t mean shit. Actually finishing whatever I was supposed to within 3 months does mean _something_ &#8211; especially since I&#8217;ve taken on quite a bit of stuff to do (Move to new language + 2 new features). I&#8217;m quite the n00b &#8211; first time I&#8217;ll be doing just _one_ thing over 3 months. Will be setting up a way of monitoring progress (probably via set milestones) soon enough. Will keep this place posted :)

Also, say Hi to my mentor [daniel siegel][4]. Him and fellow cheese-dev [Flippio Argiolas][5], who were extremely helpful in getting my proposal whipped into shape (It&#8217;s a gist, so you can see how it eveolved over time). 

The Oscar acceptance style blog post will be turned in once the three months are over and the newer, improved Cheese is accepted as good enough :D
