One of the major advantages of my netbook is that I can actually use it in class, under the desk &#8211; and most staff won&#8217;t notice ;) And even if they do, I can easily and neatly close the lid, put it in standby and become innocent good boy :D

I&#8217;ve zoned out from what&#8217;s happening in class a long time back. I just looked up, and it&#8217;s something I really do like (withheld to protect the name of subject). It&#8217;s being taught in a &#8216;marks-oriented&#8217; way &#8211; &#8220;You need to write this for this much marks, and that for that much mark. Don&#8217;t you dare to miss this line, then YOU WILL GET ZERO MARKS!&#8217;. I look around. Most people are either texting others, or dutifully copying down what is being written on the board (which itself is copied from some TextBook). I zone out again.

8 hours a day. Waking up everyday at an ungodly 6 AM. Around 2 Lakhs not counting auxillary expenses. 2 hour commute that makes you wish you were dead, after giving you an awful back pain. A huge set of lessons in politics.

I wonder what I&#8217;m getting out of this. What _anybody_ is getting out of this.
