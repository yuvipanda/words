Absolutely hilarious, but you could easily dub out a few words and have it pass for real. Not sure if funny or sad.



Has quote about how Jesus was Indian, because among other things, because &#8220;Parents had a son without having sex&#8221;.

This entire BBC series ([Goodness Gracious Me)][1] is incredibly hilarious. Most of them are [on Youtube][2]. HighlyÂ recommended.

Thanks to QCoder from #wikipedia-en for the tip. Cheered up an otherwise bad day :)
