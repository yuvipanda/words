Earlier this month I spent a couple of days as a &#8216;guest&#8217; at Infosys Mahindra City (district finals for [Aspirations 2020][1] &#8211; a TopCoder style programming competition). Interesting experience.

No laptops allowed. No storage devices either. Cameras are okay, but &#8220;_please don&#8217;t take pictures&#8221;_. Phones are okay too. The usual complimentary grope as you enter. Random security guards ask &#8220;_Where is your ID card?&#8221;_ at random times. Buses bringing in hordes of people. Couples being couply in food courts. Reasonably good food. Formal clothes, without regard to the weather.  Everyone smiles when talking (unless they&#8217;re security guards). Respectful deference to hierarchical authority (with a big smile & explicit announcements of gratefulness). Unlocked cycles to travel around the campus.

A vague sense of order, but no sense of purpose.

This is what people are trying to (and mostly succeeding) in making Engineering &#8216;education&#8217; resemble. If you&#8217;ve made peace with how engineering colleges are, you&#8217;ll feel completely at home at Infosys. Accident?
