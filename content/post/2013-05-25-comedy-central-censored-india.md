Comedy Central has [been banned][1] in India for the next ten days. Reasons?

> Whereas, the programme showed a man performing an act of stand_up comedy and mouthing vulgar words accompanied by obscene and suggestive gesture and gyration. During his performance, the man was shown uttering dialogues denigrating women, indecently and crudely referred to sex organs of men-and women and the sing-song rendition by the man sought to pornographically describe .the male lust, depicting women as a commodify of sex. The portrayal appeared to deprave, corrupt and injure the public morality or morals

By that logic, I suppose 90% of all Indian Movies (and especially songs) should be banned too.
