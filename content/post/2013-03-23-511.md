[Whatsaapp][1] (and GTalk) has completely replaced SMS for me. The only sore point was that it was not &#8216;Android&#8217;y enough &#8211; looked too much like an iOS port, but it worked well enough (and had enough people in it) that my forays into [Hike][2] were never long enough. The latest update fixes the design to be a lot more flat and pleasing to the eyes, and I&#8217;m quite happy to stick to it. (Plus I just ran into their post about [why Advertising sucks][3], so doubly happy to support them :) )
