Was a great idea! It just worked (with an OTP cable), and I can now probably find much more uses for this thing than I could before. Yay!

I wonder if I can use this to write code. However, a 7 inch tablet is very poorly suited for that task &#8211; would need at least a 10&#8243; one. But there aren&#8217;t many of those going around these days&#8230;

I&#8217;ll probably use this for random browsing / commenting, and use my Mac for actual programming.
