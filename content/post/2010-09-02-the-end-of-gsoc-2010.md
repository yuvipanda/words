Google Summer of Code ended a while back. Me (and most on #gsoc) agreed on one thing &#8211; WHERE DID THOSE 3 MONTHS GO? Amazing time it was &#8211; thanks to [_ke][1] (Who is frolicking somewhere in Thailand right now), [fargiolas][2] and the rest of the GNOME guys (#clutter, #gstreamer and #gtk+ yay!) for making it awesome. #hackers-india was a great venting place too :)

[Cheese][3]&#8216;s [master][4] needs quite a bit of work before it can be included in [GNOME 3.0][5] &#8211; and I plan on doing most of that. It&#8217;s fun &#8211; demoing it at college is a huge hit. Looks like eventually, my [original goal][6] for Cheese might be met ;)

Right now, I&#8217;m decompressing, and basically not doing anything at all &#8211; except getting a bike, and sorting out some personal issues. Should be back coding (and blogging) soon. Have a huge post on GSoC experience coming up.
