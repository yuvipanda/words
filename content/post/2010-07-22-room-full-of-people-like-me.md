<div class="codehilite">
  <pre>    <span class="s">"I can&#39;t tell you how wonderful it was - I walked into this room, and it was full of people like me"</span>
                </pre>
</div>

I would give an arm, a leg, an eye and other assorted body parts if I could find such a room. And live there.
