Wooooo!

  * Moved [labsbooks][1] (described in [yesterday&#8217;s devlog][2]) to use a shared readonly IPython virtualenv maintained by me. Also installed a bunch of modules people might want to use (SciPy, NumPy, Pandas, PyTables, matplotlib). Am considering just installing IPython notebook globally via puppet and using that, since that&#8217;ll enable users to just use the system packages. However, the version of IPython notebook from Ubuntu is ancient, so that&#8217;s probably a non-starter.
  * Have a basic version of the IPython publishing process working! Any toollabs user can create a notebook by: 
      * Creating a `~/notebooks` folder
      * Doing a `chmod +x ~/notebooks`
      * Doing a `chmod +x ~`
      * Putting IPython notebooks into `~/notebooks` (as `.ipynb`) files
      * Going to `https://tools.wmflabs.org/notebooks/<user-shell-name>/<path-to-ipynb-file>` Will have to do a bit more work before it can be considered &#8216;production grade&#8217; (such as user pages, a nicer theme, etc, etc) BUT YAY GOOD START. It already caches the html output in Redis and invalidates with the `mtime` of the file, so should be pretty quick.
  * Made the ssh tunneling process for `labsbooks` purely python, without requiring the `ProxyCommand`. This makes things simpler (and more portable!). I&#8217;ll need to work on securing this properly before I can publish it for broader use.
  * Wrote [an email][3] to the analytics mailing list about making public the &#8216;edits per country&#8217; data. I hope to make this publicly available with enough granularity that not just me but others can use this for fun research as well.

I&#8217;ve been using [Atom][4] for puppet stuff, [PyCharm][5] for Python and [IntelliJ][6] for Java stuff, and that seems to be doing ok. They all have decent Vim keybindings as well, and good replacements for other functionality &#8211; and I might stick with Atom for a while to see how it goes :)
