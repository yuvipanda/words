  1. Looks like I&#8217;m going to be rewriting SelectionSifter&#8217;s UI a lot. No more QuickTemplates, as I found TablePager. Mediawik definitely needs to fix [Bug #1][1] soon.
  2. Added proper i18n for SelectionSifter.
  3. Redid FilterRatings page completely.
  4. Went through PhoneGap documentation, checked out state of its Photo handling API. Looks good.
  5. Checked out [patch][2] to official Wikipedia app that adds upload functionality. Needs lot more polish.
