I&#8217;m blogging from (one of the many) browsers on this Raspberry Pi. Testing setting it up to do slideshows during [JSFoo 2012][1].

THIS IS SO COOL!

I am now editing this blog post from my new Nexus 7. 

THIS IS SO COOL!

I am a few years behind the curve on this. Last year was spent slogging my ass out at a wonderful startup and travelling to a lot of places meeting and working with some wonderful people. Left very little time for staying on the bleeding edge.

Changing that fast &#8211; trying to produce useful stuff while also staying close to the bleeding edge. Fun times ahead :-)
