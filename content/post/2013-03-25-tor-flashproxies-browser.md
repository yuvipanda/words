Tor is one of those things that you don&#8217;t really need at all until you really really need it. I don&#8217;t need it right now, but I still try to help it as much as possible. One of the easiest way to do so is to run a [flashproxy][1]Â (has nothing to do with Adobe!) on your browser &#8211; super simple to setup, and effective for people looking for [bridges][2].

The easiest way to use it if you&#8217;re a Chrome user is to use the [CupCake][3] extension (the initial colorscheme is a bit&#8230; geocities-y, but I&#8217;ve sent in [a patch][4] to fix that). You can also add [this snippet][5] to your Mediawiki wiki either as a userscript or gadget. If you&#8217;re running a site, you can simply use [the snippet on the flashproxy site][6] to have it run for all your visitors.
