I've been on the Internet since I was 14. And I don't remember a time when I did not have a computer &#8211; I think I got mine when I was 10. Growing up, writing code has always been a major part of me &#8211; my identity. I've never quite managed to separate 'me' from 'my code' &#8211; despite mouthing off the soundbite 'You are not your code!' to plenty of people. 

After Wikimania 2013, I spent a week in Hong Kong. The first few days were rough, but after that &#8211; it was amazing. For the first time I could imagine, I had completely managed to not think about code at all! I had my laptop locked in a locker somewhere, and didn't even bother getting to it. I didn't feel the burning urge to make a commit. The feeling of guilt that keeps gnawing at you from the back of the head 'teehee you have been so unproductive today!'. 

That was a rather great feeling. Put things into a little bit more perspective. A step towards separating my identity from my code. I gave up on my GitHub streaks after that. I'll probably also be less of a codeaholic. 

I could write about 'oh my god, this was amazing!' and detail where I travelled in Hong Kong, but I think what was far more fascinating was _how_. I did not feel in a hurry. Did not feel like having to 'tick all boxes' before leaving. Just&#8230; actually relaxing. And doing whatever. 

Vacations are good :)
