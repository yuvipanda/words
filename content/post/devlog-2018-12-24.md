## Gracefully exiting asyncio application

Continuing yesterday's work on my [simple supervisor library](https://github.com/yuvipanda/simpervisor),
I continued trying to propagate signals cleanly to child processes
before exiting. I remembered that it isn't enough to just propagate
signals - you also have to actually reap them. This meant waiting
for `wait` calls on them to return.

I had a task running concurrently that is waiting on these 
processes. So 'all' I had to do was make sure the application
does *not* exit until these tasks are done. This turned
out to be harder than I thought! After a bunch of reading, I
recognized that what I needed to do was make sure I wait
for all pending tasks before actually exiting the application.

This was more involved than I thought. It also must be done
at the application level rather than in the library - you don't
want libraries doing sys.exit, and definitely don't want them
closing event loops. 

After a bunch of looking and playing, it *looks* like what I want is
in my application code is something like:


```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()
    try:
        loop.run_until_complete(main())
    finally:
        loop.run_until_complete(asyncio.gather(*asyncio.Task.all_tasks()))
        loop.close()
```

This waits for all tasks to complete before exiting, and seems
to make sure all child processes are reaped. However, I have a 
few unresolved questions:

1. What happens when one of the tasks is designed to run forever,
   and never exit? Should we cancel all tasks? Cancel tasks after
   a timeout? Cancelling tasks after a timeout seems most
   appropriate.
2. If a task schedules more tasks, do those get run? Or are they
   abandoned? This seems important - can tasks keep adding more
   tasks in a loop?

I am getting a better handle on what people mean by 'asyncio is
more complicated than needed'. I'm going to find places to read
up on asyncio internals - particularly how the list of pending
tasks is maintained.

This [series of blog posts](https://www.roguelynn.com/words/asyncio-we-did-it-wrong-pt-1/)
and [this EuroPython talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1lJDZx6f6tY)
from [Lynn Root](https://www.roguelynn.com/) helped a lot.
So did [Saúl Ibarra Corretgé](https://github.com/saghul) (one of the asyncio core devs) 
talk on [asyncio internals](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HppNu0-ANYw)

### Testing

Testing code that involves asyncio, signals and processes is
hard. I attempted to do so with `os.fork`, but decided that is
super-hard mode and I'd rather not play. Instead, I wrote Python
code verbatim that is then spawned as a subprocess, and use
stdout to communicate back to the parent process. The child process'
code itself is [inline](https://github.com/yuvipanda/simpervisor/blob/b130203a0a497d26f438a6ab3c9511a3c3de60ab/tests/test_atexitasync.py#L13)
in the test file, which is terrible. I am going to move it to its
own file.

I also added tests for multiple signal handlers. I've been writing
a lot more tests in the last few months than I was before. I credit
[Tim Head](https://github.com/betatim) for a lot of this. It definitely
gives me a lot more confidence in my code.
