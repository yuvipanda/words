I used [gist][1] to publish [my GSoC proposal][2]. Diffs, easy to show off, and Markdown support &#8211; made gist perfect for me to make modifications and get feedback easily.

It is the first &#8216;real&#8217; document I&#8217;ve written &#8211; it actually had a tangible effect.

Now that I don&#8217;t need to make any modifications, I&#8217;ve [moved it to my site][3].
