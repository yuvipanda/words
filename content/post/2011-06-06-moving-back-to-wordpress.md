A while back, I [moved my blog][1] (from a wordpress install whose data I lost) to my own platform ([HiSlain][2]).

After several close calls, I&#8217;m officially moving from HiSlain back to WordPress. I just don&#8217;t have enough time to maintain all the things I wanted in a blog platform in HiSlain, hence the move back. However, it satisfied it&#8217;s purpose &#8211; I learnt to write code I could use, others could use, and [others could contribute to][3]. The [old blog][4] is still around (all permalinks would work) if you&#8217;re interested.

It&#8217;s good to be back :)

I miss writing posts in Vim though &#8211; expect to find/write a plugin that&#8217;ll let me blog/compose from Vim. Suggestions?
