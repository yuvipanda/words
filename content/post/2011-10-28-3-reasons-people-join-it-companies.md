Source: Friend of mine who is sadly &#8216;training&#8217; at a big &#8216;IT company&#8217; now (He wishes to remain anonymous, and I could see why)

  1. Because everyone else did
  2. Because parents told
  3. Because it will be very sophisticated and relaxing there, with lots of recreational facilities

I&#8217;m just going to leave this here, and hope that when this boom does bust, it doesn&#8217;t leave too many dead bodies in its wake.
