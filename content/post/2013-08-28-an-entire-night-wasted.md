[Warning: Childish rant ahead]

My natural sleep cycle seems to be one that tends towards the darker times &#8211; sleeping before 3AM feels like an abomination, before midnight unheard of. My best work seems to be done between 2AM and 5AM. My current 'sleep cycle' has me sleeping at about 8AM, and waking up at about 5PM. Plenty of sleep for the day, eh?

It is probably not healthy. I don't look, or feel healthy. But that is the way it is.

SO IT FUCKING SUCKS WHEN THE POWER GOES OUT AT MIDNIGHT, BECAUSE I HAD JUST STARTED GETTING SHIT DONE. AND THEN YOUR PHONE REFUSES TO TETHER INTERNET, BECAUSE FUCKING ASSHOLES. AND THEN THE POWER COMES BACK AFTER THREE FUCKING HOURS AND YOU STILL CAN NOT GET ON THE INTERNET BECAUSE THE FUCKING LINE IS DEAD. IT IS MIDNIGHT AND YOU ARE IN FUCKING CHENNAI SO YOU CAN NOT EVEN GET THE FUCK OUT OF THIS PRISON. YOU CAN NOT SLEEP BECAUSE YOU JUST WOKE UP. FUCK THIS SHIT.

I'm scarily addicted to the internet. All my friends are there.
