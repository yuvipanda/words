It&#8217;s a pretty nice podcast, produced by the same people who do the &#8216;This American Life&#8217; one.

  * It makes great gym listening material!
  * The fact that the prosecution kept saying &#8216;his double life, his evil side&#8217; because he was a muslim pakistani immigrant kid who &#8216;lost everything&#8217; when he gave up his religion to date a girl apparently did not ring any alarm bells anywhere. Yay sterotyping!
  * Probably not the best use case, but from off hand comments of &#8216;you know how it is like when you are a teenager in high school&#8217; when they discuss &#8216;normal&#8217; events, I am not too sad that I wasn&#8217;t a teenager in highschool in the USA.
