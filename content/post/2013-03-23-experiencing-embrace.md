I am too young to remember Microsoft doing anything that could be considered _effective_ &#8216;Embrace, Extend & Extinguish&#8217; (my first browser when using internet at home was Firefox 0.9), and hence could never appreciate the general suspicion with which everything Microsoft was viewed with. Google&#8217;s handling of Reader has remedied that for me, however. I was around to witness all the events that [Ed Bott at ZDNet discusses][1], and hopefully I have learnt my lesson.

Fool me once&#8230;
