Not very code heavy

  * Couple of pull requests([#1][1] and [#2][2]) for the [Atom Autosave plugin][3]. One adds a preference to not autosave by when you are explicitly closing a window / pane, and the other just sets the &#8216;enabled&#8217; preference to default. CoffeeScript isn&#8217;t too bad either! I should consider writing more plugins (I currently use Atom for CSS/JS/Puppet, should try other languages)
  * Added CSV, TSV and JSON download options to Quarry. There&#8217;s another Webinar tomorrow by the Grantmaking team, and J-Mo asked for it. Streaming TSV and CSV implemented in a neat way, will write a blog post tomorrow about it.
  * Started work on a &#8216;number of editors&#8217; per country metric for WPDMZ, needs to be finished up.

I feel a bit exhausted (physically and mentally) from the intense coding over the last few weeks, might have a few chill days to recharge myself. I&#8217;m growing old! :(
