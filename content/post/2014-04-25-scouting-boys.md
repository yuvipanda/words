In [Welcome to the Machine][1] there is a line that goes &#8220;provided with toys and scouting for boys&#8221;. I had initially assumed that it was referring to a young guy who is gay and is &#8216;scouting for boys&#8217;.

And then a few days later I realized that it is talking about &#8216;[the book][2]&#8216;. That is now doubly funny because of the Boy Scouts&#8217; [attitude towards gays][3]
