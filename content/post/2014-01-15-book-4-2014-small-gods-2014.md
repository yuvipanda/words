Another nice, one off Discworld book. Nice bits about how Gods are created by us, and need us more than the other way around. The philosophers are incredibly funny wherever they turn up too. The Desert after you Die bit was&#8230; beautiful &#8211; Judgement happens, but by yourself. Fun digs at governments and organized religion throughout made it rather enjoyable :)

4/5
