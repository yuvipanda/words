I&#8217;m going to be moving all my cash off ICICI and on to&#8230; somewhere else (undecided) ASAP.

They have paste disabled everywhere, by placing onpaste=&#8221;return false&#8221; on all their text elements. I know that this is easily fixable, so let me open inspector by right cli-oh!

Well, no matter &#8211; I can simply use a short cut. Once getting rid of the frustrating onpaste, I found this in the HTML right below it:

I have spent far too much time in the company of people who set in motion the process that results in stuff like this (and their blinking &#8216;NEW!&#8217; gifs), and I&#8217;m not going to be anywhere near where they are.

Now to find a Bank that hires less incompetent people&#8230;

**Update**: For good measure, they&#8217;ve now locked me out of the account, so a good part of my cash is now locked in there. Should go the physical location asap and transfer all of it out.
