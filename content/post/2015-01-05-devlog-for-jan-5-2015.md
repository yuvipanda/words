DevLog for Jan 5, 2015

Trying out the [ByWord][1] app, since it has MarkDown support and also publishes to WordPress. Paid Rs. 900 for it, let&#8217;s hope it is useful. Hate the default font, though.

  * Need to parse View definitions on labsdb public databases and verify that we aren&#8217;t leaking any info (https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T85783). Was going to use the [sqlparse][2] library, but that doesn&#8217;t seem very complete or useful. Will attempt to use regexes now. Wish I had learnt how to build parsers properly easily.
  * Ignore lament ^, I spent some time learning to use PyParsing, and ended up with a very simple parser that parsed the small subset of SQL I cared about! Yay :) Still need to set aside some time at some point to fully understand parsers/parsing.
  * Fixed wikdidata beta not resolving (https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T85793). Of course, problem was caused by me as well, not verifying that DNS changes I was making didn&#8217;t have unintended consequences. It&#8217;s also somewhat surprising that it was down for 6 days before someone noticed.
  * Add labsdb-auditor report that verifies views have appropriately done definitions that do not expose private information (https://gerrit.wikimedia.org/r/#/c/182848/). This was fun to write. I should definitely learn more parsing things and seek out other simpel things I can write a parser for. Code quality is getting better, although could still be better if I can remove the regex part entirely &#8211; it currently cleans up the SQL via a regex and then parses it with pyparsing.
  * Fixed a consistency bug in the perl script that maintians public view replicas (https://gerrit.wikimedia.org/r/#/c/182819/).

Reading list: * [What most young programmers need to learn][3] was nice. I just feel lucky to have been gifted a copy of Code Complete and Pragmatic Programmer when I was 15 (by [Colinizer][4]).
