_I&#8217;ve started keeping devlogs, recording productive activity every day in an attempt to publicly shame myself into doing productive things. This is the delayed march edition_

### Mar 20 &#8211; 31

More contract work for more money.

My dump patch to meidawiki got commited, then blasted during Code Review. This is what I get for trusting other people&#8217;s code blindly, especially after 5 years. Lesson learnt. Fixed all issues, and now waiting for a review before commit.

More help for Madhu&#8217;s GSoC, on and off. Same for Arun and Karthik. 

Decide to give up on dumps (no concrete work found) and pick up wikipedia offline, after post to wikitech-l by the offline guy saying he is looking for people. 

Channels #mediawiki and #wikimedia-tech are quite fun, actually. Not bad at all.

Started writing php code. Not that ugh, actually. 

Spent 3 days at In50Hrs. Prototyped the CollegeReviews thing I was always dreaming about. Concepts were fleshed out really well. Need to spend more time on this thing.

### Mar 15 &#8211; 20

Almost got fix to Mediawiki that made dumps 5% faster. Now just need to prove it on a larger scale before it gets accepted.

Did contracting work for some decent money. Feels pretty good.

Started helping madhu with her gsoc. She&#8217;s darn smart. 

### Mar 14

Did bits of resume.

### Mar 1-13

Some amount of Mediawiki work &#8211; getting it to run, learning how to profile it, profiling the import and export process. Identified a hotspot in the export process (UtfNormal), need to try to get a fix in.

Moved main system from Ubuntu 32 bit to Debian 64 bit. Yay. Tried to jhbuild gnome-shell and failed miserably. Boo. 

Started helping other folks with their GSoC. Yay.
