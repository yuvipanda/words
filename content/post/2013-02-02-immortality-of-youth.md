    Reading [this blog post][1] from <del>Wesley Crusher</del><ins>Wil Wheaton</ins> reminded me first of my visit to the beach a few hours before [Cyclone Nilam][2] hit landfall (at the Thiruvanmiyur Beach). The fact that I couldn't stand in one place (wind) and was constantly being attacked by sand - it was exhilarating.
    
    The blog post also reminded me of how much I mis-treat my body. I'm surprised I'm not bedridden, immovable and with a host of diseases. Trading health for a wealth of incredible stories.
    
    Immortality of youth, or plain old luck. Hopefully I'll wisen up before one of them

Immortality of youth, or plain old luck. Hopefully I&#8217;ll wisen up before either of them run out.
