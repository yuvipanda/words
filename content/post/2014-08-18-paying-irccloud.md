I&#8217;ve started paying for [IRCCloud][1].

It is the first &#8216;service&#8217; I am paying for as a subscriber, I think. I&#8217;ve considered doing that for a long time, but &#8216;paying for IRC&#8217; just felt&#8230; odd. I&#8217;ve been using [ZNC][2] + [LimeChat][3]. It&#8217;s decent, but sucks on Mobile. Keeping a socket open all the time on a phone just kills the battery, plus the UX on most Android clients sucks.

So after seeing [Sam Smith][4] use IRCCloud during Wikimania, I made the plunge and paid for IRCCloud. It is still connecting to my bouncer, so I have logs under my control. It also has a very usable Android client, and syncs &#8216;read&#8217; status across devices, and is quite fast.

Convenience and UX won over &#8216;Free Software&#8217; this time.
