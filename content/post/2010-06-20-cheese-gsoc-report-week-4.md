Fourth week of the Summer of Code was over a few days back, and this report is overdue :( I&#8217;ve not been able to code as much as I wanted to this week &#8211; due to various non-technical issues. Will compensate in the next week.

Last week&#8230;

  1. Countdown Animations (Thanks to _ke for cleanup!)
  2. GConf Cleanup

Yes, that was it. 

Totally failed to meet last week&#8217;s goals. Sigh.

By next week, I hope to have accomplished&#8230;

  1. Video Effects file format reader
  2. Basic Effects application to the currently playing pipeline.
  3. Mockups on best weay to present effects UI to user

Here is to hoping the coming week turns out better than last one :)
