Here is an approximate timeline of the **editors** I&#8217;ve used so far:

  * Turbo C++ (4th grade to 8th grade)
  * Visual Basic 6 (8th grade to 10th grade)
  * Visual Studio 2005 (10th grade to 11th grade)
  * Visual Studio 2008 (11th grade to 1st year of college)
  * gVim (1st year of college)
  * GNU Emacs (after gVim)

Now, the one thing, maybe even the _only_ thing I miss is the fact that gVim gives me the I-Bar cursor, while Emacs by default gave me the block cursor. I like the I-Bar better than the block, and so far, couldn&#8217;t figure out how to change that. It&#8217;s not helping that I don&#8217;t have access to the internet.

So what does a sane man do?

He stops using the GTK version of Emacs, and switches to the console version :D
