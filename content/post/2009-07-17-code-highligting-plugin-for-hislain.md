I&#8217;ve been hacking &#8217;round with [HiSlain][1], and wrote a syntax highlighting plugin for it. Nothing fancy &#8211; just uses [Pygments][2], but the process of modifying the plugin architecture to support this has been an awesome ride. I&#8217;ll probably open up a new GitHub project just for HiSlain Themes and Plugins.

And since I&#8217;ve to test out Syntax Highlighting,

<div class="codehilite">
  <pre><span class="k">print</span> <span class="s">"I kinda like Python :)"</span>
                </pre>
</div>
