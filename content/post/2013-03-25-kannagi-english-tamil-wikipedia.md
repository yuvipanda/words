Kannagi is a rather popular character in Tamil folklore &#8211; and also because there&#8217;s [a famous statue][1] of her&#8217;s in a prominent landmark at the [Marina beach][2]. Everyone&#8217;s heard bits and pieces of the story of Kannagi, and also sees the name used in insults against someone&#8217;s lack of chastity (பெரிய கண்ணகி இவ, castigating someone for pretending to be as chaste as Kannagi was supposed to be).

The English Wikipedia article on her is interesting. There&#8217;s an entire &#8216;The Story&#8217; section, which has no inline citations, and has this gem of a paragraph:

> Kannagi came to the king&#8217;s court, broke open the anklet seized from Kovalan and showed that it contained rubies, as opposed to the queen&#8217;s anklets which contained pearls. Realizing their fault, the King and the Queen died of shame. Unsatisfied, Kannagi tore out a breast and flung it on the city, uttering a curse that the entire city be burnt (the old, the children and the disabled were spared). Due to her utmost [Chastity][3], her curse became a reality.
