**Potential trigger warning**

I keep trying to tell myself &#8220;People are not evil. They are just doing the best they can with what they have&#8221;. But then I&#8217;ve to read shit like [this][1], and I&#8217;m not so sure anymore. 

Growing up to lose respect for people you considered heros is a horrible thing. Friends don&#8217;t let friends fall prey to emotional blackmail.
