## Physical activity

I walked for about 6 miles yesterday evening, after doing 3-4 miles each day for about 2-3 days before. The roads were empty, and it was lovely. I've listened to maybe 6-10 hours of [Deborah Frances-White](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deborah_Frances-White) in the last week or so, split between [The Guilty Feminist](http://guiltyfeminist.com/) and [Global Pillage](http://globalpillage.net/). Next time though, I'm going to try listen to podcasts less & observe my surroundings more. I am doing this (plus PT) to rehab my knee mostly. I slept for 12h yesterday night :)

## Asyncio deadlock

I don't have enough experience with the pitfalls of concurrent programming where you *have* to use [synchronization](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-sync.html) techniques. I had my first deadlock today, and after a few minutes realized it was actually an infinite recursion from a typo. I need to get a better theoretical understanding of both event loop based async programming and synchronization methods. I've used them with threading & Java, but feel shaky in asyncio. 

simperviser now has 100% unit test coverage. But it combines asyncio,
processes & signals - so that doesn't give me enough confidence as it might have otherwise. I'll take it though :)


## VSCode customization

I've been re-reading the pragmatic programmer again (after initially reading it about 12 years or so ago). A lot of it still holds up, although some stuff is date (love for Broken Window policing & perl). It reminded me that I hadn't really spent much time customizing and being more productive in VSCode, so am spending time today doing that.

I switch between vscode and my terminal quite a bit, mostly for git operations and running tests. I'm going to see if I can stay inside vscode comfortably for running pytest based tests.

It made me very sad that the only thing I wanted from the pytest integration in vscode is something the maintainers aren't actively working on - [shortcut to run test the cursor is currently at](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-python/issues/637). I also can't seem
to see test output directly.

I think I'll be using the Terminal for pytest runs for now. I'm not even going to try with git.

If I was younger and not already full of projects to do, I'd have picked up and tried to make a PR for this. Boo time commitments.
