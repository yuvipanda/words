Python's [PEP8][1] has just been [changed][2] to no longer recommend sticking to 79 columns! The new text says:

    Aim to limit all lines to a maximum of 79 characters, but up to 99 characters is acceptable when it improves readability.

It would be nice to not have any such set limits at all, and just depend on programmers not being insane, but this is still an improvement!
