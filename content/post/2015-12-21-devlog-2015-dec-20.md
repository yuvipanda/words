Probably going to take it easy and chill. Already sent a [trivial PR][1] up though.

Also saw the old [devlog mailing list][2] and feeling happy memories. Clearly need to bring something back like that, but I don&#8217;t know / think mailing lists are the best medium. More thinking!

Ended up learning some [Tornad][3] and wrote [nbserve][4] to serve rendered notebooks and static files in a configurable way. I should refactor PAWS to have separate jupyterhub, proxy and nbserve pods tomorrow. Also need to test for path traversal attacks and whatnot. Also coroutine based programming is a lot easier than I had originally thought! woo!
