  * Kicked out NFS from the Tool Labs proxies (with [1][1]). Yay! This hopefully explains the lockup of tools-proxy-01 yesterday night, maybe? It&#8217;s been restarted since, and I hope to no longer have instances randomly locoking on me. Infrastructure standards of 2009, here we come! :D
  * Fixed up all the races in how kubernetes workers are setup with [2][2]
  * Another instance is &#8216;stuck&#8217; again. Sigh. AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA. I&#8217;ll debug later, I suppose?

Bundling in 22 as well&#8230;

  * Woke up to huge `ksoftirqd` runs on the tools proxies.
