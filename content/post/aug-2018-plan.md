I'm writing up monthly 'work plans' to plan what work I'm trying to do every
month, and do a retrospective after to see how much I got done. I work across
a variety of open source projects with ambiguous responsibilities, so work
planning isn't very set. This has proven to be somewhat quite stressful for
everyone involved. Let's see if this helps!

## JupyterCon ##

JupyterCon is in NYC towards the end of August, and it is going to set the pace
for a bunch of stuff. I have 2.5-ish talks to give. Need to prepare for those and
do a good job.

## Matomo (formerly Piwiki) on mybinder.org ##

mybinder.org currently uses Google Analytics. I am not a big fan. It has troubling
privacy implications, and we don't get data as granularly as we want to. I am going
to try deploying [Matomo](https://matomo.org/) (formerly Piwiki) and using that 
instead. Run both together for a while and see how we like it! Matomo requires
a MySQL database & is written in PHP - let's see how this goes ;)

## The Littlest JupyterHub 0.1 release ##

[The Littlest JupyterHub](https://github.com/jupyterhub/the-littlest-jupyterhub) is
doing great! I've done a **lot** of user tests, and the distribution has changed
drastically over time. It's also the first time I'm putting my newly found 
strong convictions around testing, CI & documentation to practice. You can already
check it out [on GitHub](https://github.com/jupyterhub/the-littlest-jupyterhub). I
want to make sure we (the JupyterHub team) gets out a 0.1 release early August.

## Pangeo Workshop ##

I despair about climate change and how little agency I seem to have around it
quite a bit. I'm excited to go to the [PANGEO workshop](https://www2.cisl.ucar.edu/events/workshops/2018-pangeo-workshop/2018/2018-pangeo-workshop)
in Colorado. I'm mostly hoping to listen & understand their world some more.

## Berkeley DataHub deployment ##

Aug 20-ish is when next semester starts at UC Berkeley. I need to have a pretty
solid JupyterHub running there by then. I'd like it to have good CI/CD set up
in a generic way, rather than something super specific to Berkeley. However,
I'm happy to shortcut this if needed, since there's already so many things on
my plate haha.

## UC Davis ##

I'm trying to spend a day or two a month at UC Davis. Partially because I like
being on Amtrak! I also think there's a lot of cool work happening there,
and I'd like to hang out with all the cool people doing all the cool work.


## Personal ##

On top of this, there's ongoing medical conditions to be managed. I'm getting
Carpel Tunnel Release surgery sometime in October, so need to make sure I do
not super fuck up my hands before then. I'm also getting a cortisone shot
for my back in early August to deal with Sciatica. Fun!

## Things I'm not doing! ##


The grading related stuff I've been working on is going to the backburner
for a while. I think I bit off far more than I can chew, so time to back off.
I also do not have a good intuition for the problem domain since I've never 
written grading keys nor have I been a student in a class that got autograded.


## In conclusion... ##

Shit, I've a lot of things to do lol! I'm sure I'm forgetting some things
here that I've promised people. Let's see how this goes!
