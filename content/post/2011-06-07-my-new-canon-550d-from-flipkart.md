I was finally able to order my [Canon 550D][1] from Flipkart. Their customer service was **awesome** &#8211; both on [twitter][2] (when the camera was out of stock) and via the phone after it was ordered. I ordered Cash on Delivery, and despite some minor issues with the delivery person (uhm, so I&#8217;m supposed to hand over 39k, **and then** open the box? What if I found a box of bricks?) &#8211; I got the camera within 3 working days of ordering it. Impressive. Flipkart is awesome :)

I also got the [50mm 1.8][3] (underhanded practice by flipkart &#8211; they say free and then bump up the cost to match. Didn&#8217;t matter in this case since I was ordering it anyway, but definitely _not cool)**.**_ Incredible lens. I haven&#8217;t even tried on the Kit Lens yet &#8211; playing with the 50mm has been so much fun. Will review both camera and lens once I&#8217;ve played with it enough.

Might renew [my flickr][4] membership soon &#8211; tried [500px][5] but wasn&#8217;t good enough. Any other suggestions?
