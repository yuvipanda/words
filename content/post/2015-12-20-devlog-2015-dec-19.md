  * Today looks like a day of finding, reporting and fixing bugs in [WikiChatter][1]. I had made a stupid mistake yesterday that meant not all of the Teahouse pages were being parsed, and I immediately started running into bugs. Have reported (and fixed!) two ([1][2] and [2][3]), and ran into another [bug][4] in mediawikiparserfromhell itself. I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;ll find more.
  * Another bug in WikiChatter! [3][5]
  * Perils of digging through archives &#8211; you find Wikipedians giving [relationship advice][6].
  * Should work on https://github.com/jupyter/jupyterhub/issues/17 in some form over the next few weeks.
