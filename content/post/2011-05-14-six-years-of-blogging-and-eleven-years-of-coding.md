It was exactly six years ago that I started blogging. [My first blog post][1] ow seems to be rather childish, but considering I was 14 then, maybe it is excusable :)

I&#8217;ve moved across several blogging platforms and urls in the meantime ([Blogspot][2], wordpress and now [my own custom engine][3]. I&#8217;ve sadly lost a good portion of my blogs thanks to a domain loss and a server crash. Sigh.

Also, looks like I&#8217;ve been writing code for almost eleven years now! Not counting my turboC years, that would be 8 years now. Not bad, eh? I&#8217;ve been coding for more than 60% of my life :)
