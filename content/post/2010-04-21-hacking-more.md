Quoting from [Steven Levy][1]&#8216;s [Hackers][2]:

Building things for the fun of building them is hacking. And [hacking is not illegally breaking into computers][3]. 

I like hacking. I want to be a real hacker. I can&#8217;t call myself one yet.

I&#8217;m putting this up as a reminder to myself &#8211; about what is important and what isn&#8217;t. Here is to hoping I remember to say _No_ more often. Here is to hoping that the next time I&#8217;m bored, I write something rather than idle on IRC. GSoC (a bigger post about it coming up) is helping &#8211; a lot. 

I&#8217;ll do a monthly &#8216;things I&#8217;ve hacked on&#8217; post, and see how many things turn up on that :)
