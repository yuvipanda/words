Back in Chennai

  1. Moving yuvi.in to my [prgmr][1] server. I want wordpress for my blog, but I don&#8217;t want to run MySQL. Solution? Keep blog where it is (with the awesome [webfaction][2] people!) and use [nginx][3] to proxy requests to blog/. Seems to work, so yay!
  2. Rewrote tawp.in to use python/flask/memcached. Available on github. Replaced older node.js version
  3. Reading through _The Art of Unix Programming_ on kindle. Amazing book so far.
  4. Fixed a few more bugs on Wikipedia App. I think I&#8217;ll keep &#8216;official&#8217; Wiki related stuff off this, unless it&#8217;s big?
  5. Partied along new year&#8217;s. Yay. Not particularly &#8216;dev&#8217;, but still :)
