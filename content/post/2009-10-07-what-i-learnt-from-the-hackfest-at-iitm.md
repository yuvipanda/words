I was about to just type a list of stuff here, but that doesn&#8217;t do the topic justice. So here I am, at 3:30 in the morning, sleep cycle screwed up by the Hackfest, typing out a post on what all I learnt from there. I spent pretty much my entire awake-time at the IIT, so it helped me a lot.

#### Your college doesn&#8217;t matter much

IIT Envy. Every non-IITian has that. I spent a lot of time at IITM during the Hackfest, and while my IITEnvy did go up during the first few hours, it initially came down well below normal as I got to know the people better. What was cool about them was not _where they were studying_, but _what they were doing_. I could do what these guys were doing. Anyone can do what these guys were doing &#8211; there is nothing special about the IIT except maybe for the fact that it aggregates naturally dedicated people into pools. You don&#8217;t need an IIT for that &#8211; IRC will do :) I&#8217;m from a teeny college that nobody has heard of &#8211; that would have been a problem when people judged people by where they studied, rather than by what they did. Should not be a problem for me now :)

#### Real C isn&#8217;t hard

I was utterly clueless about GTK+ when I landed up at the IIT. The first thing I told [Arun][1] was that I was clueless about C and maybe would like to hack on something in C# or Python.

I thought I was clueless about C. All I had done was TurboC &#8211; which I had not really considered as _real_ C till that point. However, an hour into the hackfest, I realized something &#8211; Pointers and Structures are all you need! Read the docs, read some good code, and you are done. I will probably do what I usually do to learn a new language &#8211; write a significant amount of useful code in it &#8211; in C very soon.

#### Code talks

I don&#8217;t have any patches against my name. The only significant piece of code I think I have written so far is this blogging engine you are reading. That needs to change.

Doesn&#8217;t mean I have to churn out code like a copier machine &#8211; I just have to have enough things to point to and be able to proudly say &#8216;I did that&#8217;. Great Documentation, proper deployment options and a little evangelism helps too. None of my code has any of that. That has to change too.

#### Know tools well

I use Emacs. But not to its fullest potential. Same thing for pretty much all of my tools &#8211; Bash/Powershell, Build Tools, etc. Heck, I can&#8217;t even write a shell script to save my life! That has to change, and change fast. I smell perl.

#### People on IRC are friendly

I&#8217;ve always been a lurker on IRC, just listening and not daring to speak. That changed _drastically_ once I actually met these really nice people in person &#8211; so I can see my IRC usage going way up! It has also expanded my horizons quite a bit &#8211; meeting new people, getting to know people better, constantly being challenged to actually get off my ass and write some stuff, etc. 

#### TODO

  * Read more code. File bugs. Try to fix bugs. 
  * Learn Perl. Learn C. Learn C++. Get much better at Python.
  * Go through my [code][2], document all the necessary parts, create home pages for the significant ones.
  * IRC more. I have been &#8211; the last two days have seen my IRC usage skyrocket.
  * Stop cribbing about my life and get on with it!
