I was writing a post on how 2009 ended. Here is the tl;dr version: It was my &#8216;growing-up&#8217; year in Tech, and &#8216;roller-coaster&#8217; year in personal stuff. There! I&#8217;m certainly significantly wiser at the end of 2009, and that is due more to my state at the beginning of 2009 than at the end :) Good enough

So how did I celebrate? By joining the KPP _competition_ at Kurukshetra. That&#8217;s what I did at around 12 on New Year&#8217;s. Not intentionally, mind you. Just happened.

Then, on 2nd Jan, I did something interesting. On a whim, I took my bicycle, and rode an hour in traffic. Alone. To Marina Beach.

And then I spent the next hour sitting near the waves. Looking around. Just enjoying myself. And then rode back home, and for the first time in over 4 years, slept before 12.

I did it again the next day. With a friend this time. My knees were already killing me since I practically had no physical activity before this. But I still did it again. My knees would literally kill me now if they had a way to.

I&#8217;m happy. Teen Angst has taken a break :)

Let this year be the one when I remove external dependencies on my happiness :)
