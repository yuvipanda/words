I am trying to find a nice way to keep thoughts, ideas and notes outside my head for a few months now. 
I worked my way through many applications, trying to use the system they promote as the basis for my own. Along the journey, I got a better sense of what was important to me in such an application. I'll walk through the various applications I've tried, along with the criteria I've developed by the end

## Evernote

First stop, big one. I already had misgivings about it being from a large corporation. I still paid for it, and tested it out for a few months. 

* No markdown support. This immediately became a problem - I had no idea how much I've come to expect markdown wherever I type. They have been [asked for markdown support](https://discussion.evernote.com/topic/118932-native-markdown-support/) many times, but I don't think this is ever going to happen. I realized that **markdown support is a minimum requirement** for me
* Conflict resolution when I edited the same note in multiple places was really terrible. Completely unusable. I've 3 devices I use regularly - an iPad Pro, a Macbook and my Android Phone. Through this experience I discovered that **proper cross-device syncing is very important** for me as well.
* I paid Evernote so I could work offline. I already have a lot of anxiety about not having internet access (a topic for another post), and didn't want to not have access to these if I don't have internet access. This wasn't very good thanks to the shitty conflict resolution, but the process made me realize that I cared a lot about **full offline availability**
* I also hated the UI. It was clunky, had way too many options, and none of the options I really wanted.
* There was no way to link notes together I found. I realized that my time at wikimedia had made me very accustomed to hyperlinking as a way of writing. Evernote had no clear affordances for doing this. So **hyperlinking** became important to me. I could also smile at the big impact Wikimedia has had on the way I think :D This was the beginning of me recognizing that a purely hierarchical setup might not work for me...

I noticed I was using Evernote less and less, and wandered the desert for a while.

## OneNote

I had been using OneNote on and off for a while. It has some of the same problems Evernote has. But the absolute no-go for me was how it handled text notes on my laptop.

This __feature__ killed it. It was too much mental load, and I hated the extra UI it brought. It had most of the problems evernote did, and worse.

## List applications

At this point, I read some parts of [Getting Things Done](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1633.Getting_Things_Done) again, trying to control my sprawling, anxiety-filled work life. It was useful, as always, but mostly to remind me to **not use my brain to store data**.

I then spent a bunch of time bouncing between different **todo list apps**, as a way to get stuff out of my brain and into a list. Learning about [kinder todo lists](https://www.becktench.com/blog/2019/5/13/kinder-to-do-lists) was very helpful.

I tried a lot of these apps - Google Keep, [Nirvana](https://www.nirvanahq.com/), Evernote / OneNote, [TickTick](https://ticktick.com/). Nothing really clicked, but eventually I ended up on [Todoist](https://todoist.com/app/). The app was great, sync worked fine, and my flatmate also used it. Boom!

I was still looking for a note-taking app, which I considered quite distinct from the todo list apps. I was also finding the fixed format of todoist a bit limiting. I wanted each of my Projects to have a criteria of 'this is now done', but there wasn't an easy way to do that in Todoist. The importance given to due dates was also nagging, and gave me anxiety.

## [Inkdrop](https://www.inkdrop.app/)
Looking for cross-device markdown note taking apps led me to Inkdrop. Built by a single indie dev, [has lots of plugins](https://my.inkdrop.app/plugins), and looked quite nice. I started using it and quite liked it in the beginning. It has a [vim plugin](https://my.inkdrop.app/plugins/vim) which is an absolute requirement for me if I'm going to be writing a lot of text (or so I thought)
However, I found I wasn't using it as much. It had all the features I thought I wanted, but somehow it wasn't quite fitting the mental model I had.

## Outliners

At this point, I heard about [Roam Research](https://roamresearch.com/). It looked really neat, and was quite different from the other note taking apps. I had always dismissed [org-mode](https://orgmode.org/) for its emacs-centrism, but this made me reconsider that. However, it was in closed beta, so I let it be. I'll definitely re-visit it, especially if it has a good offline story.

I looked around for alternatives, and discovered [workflowey](https://workflowy.com/). I'll admit the list of endorsements on their home page was a big draw for me. 
However, when I tried to sign up, I got

![one note being terrible](/images/note-taking/workflowey-password.jpg)

My usual password length is 63, and it totally [failed that test](https://twitter.com/WorkFlowy/status/1261034917011632128). I also discovered [they don't support markdown](https://workflowy.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/community/posts/360007921026-Needs-some-kind-of-Markdown-syntax-support-) so that rules them out

## Dynalist
I discovered **[Dynalist](https://dynalist.io/)** as a Workflowey alternative. It has all the things I want, and I've been using it for a few days now. It's been extremely awesome! The syncing is flakey, and I have some anxiety about losing data - but otherwise, the format itself has been great for me!

So what I've realized is that I don't want a note taking app, **I wanted an outliner**. Outliners seem to match how my brain works much better than purely hierarchical note taking apps. I can take notes without having to worry about organizing them first, and then organize them afterwards as I see fit. Very low mental overhad between what is in my brain and what's on the screen. I like it.

I hope I can replace todoist with Dynalist too. I'll experiment with it later. But for now, <3 dynalist. This blog post was written in dynalist, then edited in [typora](https://typora.io/). Not bad.

## Evaluation criteria

In the end, looks like I have these needs when it comes to outliners / note taking apps.

* Markdown support, ideally with something like [KaTeX](https://katex.org/) or [MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org/) support

* Cross-device sync across platforms (Mac, iPad, Android)

* Full offline support, with sync that doesn't lose data

* Ability to hyperlink different parts of the system

  

I'll look at Roam research later, but for now, I'm enjoying having a note taking system that matches how my brain seems to think.
