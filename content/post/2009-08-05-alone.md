He was sitting in class. Bored. He looked around. He saw sixty other people, but felt alone. He stood up, shouted &#8216;Why am I here?!? This won&#8217;t do!&#8217; and walked out of the class, leaving everyone confused and weirded out.

He moved out of the campus, and saw sixty thousand other people. He still felt alone. He realized the problem is not the world, but him. Within the next few hours, the problem went away. Forever.
