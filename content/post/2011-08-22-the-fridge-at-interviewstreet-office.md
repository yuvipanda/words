We bought a fridge two days ago, and spent a day stocking it up. Perhaps it needs a bit more non-liquid content in it, but I think the choco fills and Dark Fantasy biscuits (not to mention the litres of Ice Cream we&#8217;ve stocked up on) would do just fine for now :)

And before you start harping on about &#8216;health&#8217; &#8211; the bottom tray has a mysterious cover full of apples shipped from Chennai by mom.
