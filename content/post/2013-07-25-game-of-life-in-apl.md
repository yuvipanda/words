Ran across a video explaining [building Game of Life in APL][1]. Pretty awesome, and surprisingly &#8211; quite understandable too!

I should learn [J][2] at some point, I think. My problem with trying to learn such languages is that I find it hard to find something to build that's not a mere academic exercise, and I still do not have a solution as such. Just 'try harder' doesn't really work. Perhaps invent some sort of wonderful number crunching idea and then implement it?
