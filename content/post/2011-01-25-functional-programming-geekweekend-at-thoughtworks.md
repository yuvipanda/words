_[Note: I&#8217;ve a rather large backlog of blog posts to do, will push them out as soon as I can]_

Saturday (22 Jan 2011) was spent at [Geekweekend][1], organized at [Thougtworks Chennai][2]. The event had awesomeness written all over it, even before it started &#8211; how can _any_ event where you register through a (rather limited, but still) command line interface on a website be not good? :D 

I was late as usual (damn living so far away from everywhere) &#8211; and found my way walking through the underbelly of the Kathipara junction thanks to [Google Maps&#8217; Walking Directions][3] :P

## Clojure

Missed the first session. Turned up for the clojure session &#8211; it was good. I&#8217;ve been meaning to learn one of the OMGPARANTHESES langueages, and from the tooling/library support &#8211; clojure seems to be the way to go. Spent time during the talk setting up my machine to do clojure dev (took forever to setup &#8211; it is a netbook, afterall). Wanted to build something small before the end of the event (like a URL Shortener!) but too late for that.

I do plan on writing something with clojure in the short term though. Looking for ideas.

## Lunch

Lunch. Met the usual group of geeks around. Fun, as usual :D Lunch was excellent. Me and [Superkiddo][4] continued the tradition of stealing sweets from [Kishore][5]&#8216;s plate :D

## Monads

Then came the session on [Monads][6]. I still don&#8217;t understand them. But that&#8217;s okay &#8211; the discussion was rather intellectually stimulating. It also reminded me that my mathematical/theoretical-cs foundation is incredibly weak (by geek standards) and needs updating/pushing up. Should start on [SICP][7] (_again_).

## Purely Functional Languages on the fringe

The discussions were the most fun, productive part of the day, IMO. Most people who weren&#8217;t fully interested had already left &#8211; so the self-selected crowd was rather intense. Nobody there was actually using any purely functional language in production &#8211; which was expected. My opinion is that _purely_ functional languages will always be on the fringe &#8211; as they should be. But features from them will trickle in slowly into mainstream, [blub][8] programming languages (even PHP [has lambdas][9] now!). Learning to think in a functional way will expand your mind, and make you a better programmer &#8211; even if you&#8217;re not programming in a purely functional language. 

## My Irrational Hate for Java

I&#8217;m not sure from where &#8212; perhaps the fucked up Java GUI apps, or my early stage semicolon/case-sensitivity hate (hey, I was 14, what do you expect!) or the fact that Java the language is way too verbose &#8212; I&#8217;ve had an irrational **hate** of all things Java/JVM. But that&#8217;s just that &#8211; irrational. So I&#8217;m taking a concerted effort to learn myself some JVM &#8211; hence clojure. I still don&#8217;t like Java the language (C# FTW!) &#8211; but the tools and libraries around JVM seem to be pretty good. Let&#8217;s see how this experiment at de-biasing turns out!

## Functional Programming Users group

The idea of a Functional Language Users group was floated around. Waiting for it to turn up!

**Update**: [Here you go][10]. Join up and keep posting. I&#8217;m not sure how the idea of posterous groups will work out though.

## Thoughtworks &#8216;crowd&#8217;

I&#8217;ve generally found that events organized at Thoughworks/by Thoughtworkers have higher average audience quality than most other events. Thanks for putting together events guys :)
