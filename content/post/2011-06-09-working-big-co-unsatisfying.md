**Update:** As usual, [good comments at HN][1].

I&#8217;ve been trying to put it in words for a while, and failing utterly every time. [swombat][2] gets to the crux of it wonderfully:

> At the same time, something really bothered me about my work. **It felt pointless.** One project I did (whose output was basically a PPT and Word document outlining the successes and failures of a client project), which took two and a half months, had, as its only apparent purpose, the promotion of the person who had led the project. Accenture was paid (quite well) so that I would sit there and produce a piece of paper that justified this person&#8217;s promotion.

> To me, that didn&#8217;t seem like a good use of the precious few years we have on this Earth. In fact, the feeling that I was wasting my time was really killing me inside (I&#8217;m not exaggerating).

> _[My life in Accenture before Startups][3]_

Indeed. I&#8217;d be surprised if anything in the Indian &#8220;Big Companies&#8221; are any different &#8211; perhaps worse (thoughts/experiences?).

There is a silver lining though:

> One of the most crucial things I learned in Accenture was **how to hold back my habit of being blunt and direct with everyone**. I learned to be smoother and far more effective. That&#8217;s a valuable thing to learn.

As [Vijay][4] would tell you, that&#8217;s something I&#8217;d definitely find useful &#8211; something that every geek would find useful ([relevant link about geeks being assholes][5], and [excellent HN comments][6]). Perhaps [a stint at Infosys][7] would help me there? :D
