I&#8217;ve started the habit of opening up a devlog post each morning and just filling it up as I go along. Let&#8217;s hope I can keep this up :)

  * Merged a couple of Android patches. The app is getting better every day without too much involvement from me, and yay for that :) I&#8217;ve gotten closure over the Android app &#8211; it was fucking terrible, and now it is quite awesome. Need to write another post about that.
  * Fixed annoying bug with mysql connections being reset in Quarry&#8217;s query runners after a few hours. I had fixed this earlier when I was using `pymysql` directly with reconnect(ping=True), and assumed that switching to [SQLAlchemy][1] would&#8217;ve fixed it for me automagically. [Apparently not][2]. MySQL Y U SO BAD?
  * I have `sudo` access on `labmon1001` in prod! First Wikimedia production cluster machine I have root on, and will spend time over the next few weeks setting it up to run graphite. Should be fun!
  * Getting slightly better at packaging python things. Packaged [python-txstatsd][3] with no lintian errors, and only a couple warnings :)
