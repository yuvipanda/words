Those are my new goals.

I&#8217;ve got a mechanism to track the code accomplishments (will make that public soon), and maybe I&#8217;ll write a widget for HiSlain for the blog post/day accomplishment.

I&#8217;m liking it so far &#8211; 7 hours of code yesterday, along with 2 blog posts. Couldn&#8217;t hit my code target today &#8211; but am hitting my blog target. I should figure out more ways to make this work better.

Let&#8217;s see how much I could stick to it.
