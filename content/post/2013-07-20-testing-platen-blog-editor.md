Ever since the death of [Windows Live Writer][1], I&#8217;ve never managed to find a nice blog editor that I really liked and also worked fine. I had a nice Vim plugin that posted to wordpress for a while, but that seems to have stopped working. The WordPress interface itself is mostly fine, but still a fair bit &#8216;meh&#8217;.

[Platen][2] is a markdown based editor that&#8217;s a Chrome Web Store app that looks cool so far. Let me see if it actually works.
