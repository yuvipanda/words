In Edinburgh! I&#8217;ve finally stopped spelling it as Edinborough!

  * Added &#8216;user group&#8217; functionality to Quarry, and added a `sudo` user group that does what you would think it does. Will be assigned super, super sparingly.
  * Found out that I&#8217;d have to explicitly specify charset of the database when I&#8217;m creating it or MySQL will default to a stupid charset. Forced all tables and columns to utf8 and that seems to have fixed a bunch of unicode issues. Yay?
  * Still facing occasional `MySQL server has gone away` errors with SQLAlchemy for local MySQL instance, despite asking SQLAlchemy to recycle connections every hour or so. Reduced the recycle time to 10m, hopefully that helps. 
  * Read Tony Hoare&#8217;s Turing Award speech from 1980, titled [&#8220;The Emperor&#8217;s Old Clothes&#8221;][1]. I think I should read more of these papers / speeches, helps keep perspective and &#8216;learn from history&#8217;. Lots of warnings against complexity seem to be a very common theme, and one I&#8217;ve also personally encountered many times. Recommend reading :)
  * More DMZ work! Now running edits per country stats separated by mobile vs desktop for all countries for all wikipedias! EXCITING!
