Code I have written so far:

  1. [HiSlain][1]: A static blog publishing system (NOT A DJANGO BLOG!). Runs this blog
  2. [wtfimb][2]: The code that powers [Busroutes.in][3]
  3. [frailgrey][4]: Markov Chain based page generator (pretty lame, actually)
  4. [GoodFather][5]: Collection of utils for web data scraping and storing
  5. [reappy][6]: A Twitter Search Application Framework
  6. [SadIvy][7]: A pure WSGI URL Shortener

Now, I&#8217;ve been doing a shit job of documenting them &#8211; none exists. Nor of writing tests &#8211; none exists. That should hopefully change soon :)

HiSlain and reappy are where I&#8217;m going to concentrate my efforts on for the next month or so.

#### Task List for HiSlain

  * Refactor code, clean it up so it doesn&#8217;t look like proof for the [Infinite Monkey Theorem][8]
  * Add support for raw, unmanaged pages
  * Port a decent looking, simple theme to HiSlain
  * WRITE DOCUMENTATION!
  * Write some tests, and refactor the code to make it more testable
  * WRITE MORE DOCUMENTATION!

#### Task List for reappy

  * Write a real application with it, so bugs can be fixed in the process
  * DOCUMENTATION!
  * Write some tests and refactor the code to make it more testable
  * MORE DOCUMENTATION!
  * Examples.

And ofcourse, new sub-pages over here for both of them (atleast). Stay tuned!
